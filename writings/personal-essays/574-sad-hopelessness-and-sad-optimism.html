          <p>I feel lonely, but I don't know why.<br>
            I feel dejected, but I don't know why.<br>
            I feel like crying, but I don't know why.
            </p>
          <p>Yet, I read my philosophy and it gives me some hope.<br>
            And I listen to music and I think,<br>
            "Yes, I can do that: I can be free, and unchained, and never let my dreams slip away."
            </p>
          <p>Why is it, that you can feel so alone even when around so many people?
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>I flip back and forth, day by day, even hour by hour, between sad hopelessness and sad optimism. Sad hopelessness is when 
            I feel depressed, and I am sure that things will never get better for me. Sad optimism is when I feel depressed, but I can 
            see some happiness within my future—I can see some path which I can follow that will lead me to peace.
          </p>
          <p>Earlier today, I was sad and hopeless. Now, I am optimistic, yet still sad—I always am sad. Always. There has never been a 
            day in my life where I have been truly happy. Never. There is always that tinge of sadness, of despair, of longing, of unfulfillment.
          </p>
          <p>Even when I am smiling, and laughing, and having fun, there is a voice in the back of my head which says, "No, you can't be 
            happy. Remember that one day you will die. Remember how useless everything is. Remember how lonely you feel. Remember that 
            you have no one to turn to." And sometimes there is no voice, and there is only an indistinct feeling which I can't place, 
            but which has an overwhelming effect on me. Those are the times where I feel like doing nothing at all.
          </p>
