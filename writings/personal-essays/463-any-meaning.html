          <p>I like my journal because it gives me a medium to express my thoughts. I don't like having my thoughts just 
            confined within my head, because it makes me feel like I'm alone, or trapped within myself. Seeing my ideas 
            written out here feels good, and it's interesting to look back on earlier entries to see what I was thinking back then.
          </p>
          <p>I've had some difficulty finding a meaning in life. Truly (technically), there is no meaning to life—but if I was 
            talking purely emotionally, then I would say that a meaning to life exists. This is probably what most people do when 
            they try to find a meaning. I try to look at an overall universal purpose, but most people just look to themselves 
            (which is probably the smarter move, since you are really all that you have).
          </p>
          <p>I guess the meaning to life is just to do what fulfills you. What counts as fulfilling will be different from person 
            to person. What fulfills me specifically is music. I love music. It is my great emotional outlet. I'm interested in a 
            lot of other things too. I like thinking about how a society functions: that's why I like creating languages, thinking 
            about time systems, calendar systems, alphabets, grammar structures, social hierarchies, governments, etc. It's fun to 
            think about societies and how they would work. Bringing that idea to a broader scale makes me think about how the 
            universe works.
          </p>
          <p>Everybody has something that they like to do. It might be something that damages others, or hurts themself. 
            Those types of people wouldn't be considered good people, but it could be said that they are fulfilling themselves 
            and therefore fulfilling their purpose.
          </p>
          <p>Some people say that everything happens for a reason—and it's true... things do happen for a reason. They happen 
            as consequences from other things... that is the reason for them happening. Whether the ultimate outcome is good 
            or not entirely depends on what comes before it. Things don't come out of nowhere—there is always a cause.
          </p>
          <p>How does that logic apply to the universe? Is there a cause for the existence of the universe? What actions caused 
            the universe to be created? Like I've stated in the past, the universe defies a lot of conventional logic. The 
            universe is infinite, like I've also said. Infinity is a hard thing to comprehend. In fact, it is impossible 
            except on a conceptual level.
          </p>
          <p>I would say that the universe has no meaning, technically. Life is here just because it can be. There is no other 
            reason. As intelligent life, we get to make our own meanings and live them out. They don't have any ultimate 
            significance, though—maybe that's a good thing. Maybe it's good that we don't matter because then we can do 
            whatever we want without worrying what we will affect.
          </p>
