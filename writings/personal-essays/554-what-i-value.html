          <p>I value creativity and experiencing new things. I like new perspectives and new ideas. I value this because I 
            consider myself a creative person, always seeking new things to work on. I find that I can only focus on a project 
            for a short time before it gets boring and I move onto something new. 
          </p>
          <p>The value that I place on creativity impacts my actions massively. If I’m not working on something new or thinking 
            about something from a different angle, then I feel like I’m wasting my time. It also motivates me to take up a lot 
            of hobbies and interests. One of my big life ambitions is to become a “polymath” by contributing to or investing myself 
            in many different fields of my own interest and research (I don’t intend on academically studying all of those fields). 
            Polymaths aren’t so common nowadays—in a world with increasingly deep and complex topics, it’s hard not to be a specialist. 
            But I think that devoting yourself to one topic for your entire life isn’t interesting, no matter how deep it may be.
          </p>
          <p>I have wanted to be a polymath for several years. I believe that I’m on the path to becoming one, although it’s 
            hard to judge at what point that happens (how many different fields until one can be declared a polymath?). And it’s 
            primarily not any motivation that wills me to do the things that I do: I instead have a drive. This drive moves me 
            towards my goal. Drive is very similar to motivation, but drive lasts longer and doesn’t care about feelings. 
            Motivation is a feeling—it’s a burst of energy to want to do something, and it eventually fades away. Drive is 
            long-lasting and doesn’t stop until the goal is reached. And my goal is to become a polymath, and my drive hopefully 
            won’t stop until I consider it done.
          </p>
          <p>I enjoy analysing things in my life and my beliefs to understand why I think those things, and also to lay out in more 
            detail what exactly those things are. This is why I keep a journal that I write in extensively: to record my thoughts on 
            not only my daily life, like a diary, but also to record my thoughts on complex topics in an analytical and philosophical 
            way. It’s my way of dealing with emotions and experiences. It also allows me to plan out any new projects that I might 
            want to work on, or really just think about anything that I want to do in the future. It gives me a break from all of 
            the overstimulation that social media and computer use in general gives me, and allows me time to really think about 
            my life and consider all that I’ve done up until now and what I want to get done in the near future. I think everyone 
            should allocate some of their time at least once a week to sit down and journal, because I’ve found it very helpful 
            within my life for thinking through things.
          </p>
          <p>Creativity to me is seeking the new; it’s the opposite of stagnation. Creativity to me is not just the drive to 
            create but the drive to learn and experience as well, because learning facilitates creation. In my view, stagnation 
            is the ultimate life failure. If you’re not experiencing new things or working on some new project, then are you 
            really living? Life is all of the moments in between the monotony—it’s the excitement, the new things, the major 
            experiences, and all of the things that build you and your memories. If you don’t remember it and it didn’t change 
            you in any way, then you weren’t living—and who remembers the monotony? So I’m always telling myself to do new things, 
            even though my introverted heart might not feel the same way as my driven mind. I encourage other people to try the 
            same as me whenever I find myself in a serious conversation, which admittedly isn’t very often.</p>
