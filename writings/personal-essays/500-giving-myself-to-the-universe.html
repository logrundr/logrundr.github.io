          <h3>Knowing</h3>
          <p>Life is a series of ups and downs. There are periods of terribleness that last longer than any of greatness, but the emotions of the greatness more intense than of the terribleness. Any life with any terribleness is not a life worth living. Even a single moment of terribleness ruins any of greatness. And since all life has its moments, no life is worth living at all.
          </p>
          <p>What is the reason that nature has for creating creatures? Does the universe want observers, or have we been created simply because it was possible? Obviously it is impossible that the universe would've been able to choose. The universe isn't some entity that wants us here to observe it... No—we simply exist because we can. Is that a reason to live? I don't think it is.
          </p>
          <p>Look deep enough into anything, and I think anything at all will seem meaningless. That is because, at its core, the universe has no meaning. There is nothing to find. There is no purpose—nothing that drives it. We can figure out how things work, but we will never figure out <em>why</em> they work.
          </p>
          <p>I have been meditating for short durations recently. Only a few minutes at a time, but each moment allows me to look deeper within myself. I think I am finding things that I have never noticed before. I don't know how powerful it will be to know these things, but I think I am finally beginning to understand myself. I think I finally am realising who I am. Just how to put it into words, I don't yet know—when I find out the best description, I will write it in here maybe, but it's more of a feeling than something that can be described. I simply feel like I know myself more intimately. 
          </p>
          <p>Maybe it is possible for the conscious to know itself after long study. But it doesn't come easily, certainly.
          </p>

          <h3>Rejecting Instinct</h3>
          <p>When I am hungry, I don't want to eat. When I am thirsty, I don't want to drink. I am no longer consumed by hunger. Instead I relax and let myself feel the pain, and then it doesn't hurt anymore—physical pain enduring, mental pain nonexistant.
          </p>
          <p>Let yourself be strong, and you will be. Too many people believe themself to be weak, and so they are. You are only as strong as you let yourself be. You are chaining yourself down to your mortal self. Let yourself be free and you will be better for it.
          </p>

          <h3>How?</h3>
          <p>
            How does life work? This thing that we are all tethered to... how does it function?<br>
            How are we alive, simply from the works of atoms?<br>
            How do atoms gain their properties? What determines how certain elements behave?<br>
            And what determines how the combination of elements will behave—sometimes being wildly different from the components that make it up?<br>
            How was the universe created, if it was at all created? What are the laws (or <em>the</em> law) that governs it?<br>
            Will humans ever be able to comprehend the universe?<br>
            Is the universe infinite in all directions, dimensions, and scales?
          </p>
          <p>
            I would like to see how the universe works, and all of the creatures that live in it. <br>
            I want to see everything. <br>
            I want to know everything. <br>
            I want to live forever.
          </p>
