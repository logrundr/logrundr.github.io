        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>Since we have no control over what we like and don't like, we have never been autonomously free.
          </p>
          <p>We are slaves to our desires.
          </p>
          <p>Everything that we do can be found to be done to obtain happiness. That is controlled by what we like and don't like, which is impossible to choose. Therefore, it may be concluded that humans don't have any free will because we only do actions to obtain something that is decided by uncontrollable means.
          </p>
          <p>Free will is <em>not</em> being able to do what you want when you want, because every possible permutation is already calculated out and accounted for. Every possible outcome is already decided, and all that we do is choose which path to follow; the path that we choose is ultimately driven by our desires.
          </p>
          <p>Any event is caused by previous events; because of this, almost anything in the universe can be predicted and calculated following physics equations. Are humans and creatures exempt from this? Can our actions not be predicted? Do we have free will or is everything pre-determined somehow? It would be extremely interesting if there could exist an equation that predicts the movements and actions of humans or other animals.
          </p>
          <p>We are all products of the past. You can see it yourself in my previous entries. I have written so much about the past, and indeed this whole journal is written so I may look back and read what I thought in the past. I am a product of the past. What happens influences my decisions. Everything that has happened to me, I learn from; I make conclusions on how to act in the futureâ€”how to act that will bring me the most pleasure based on what I like and don't like, which I can't control and in many ways is the same for every human. We are the sum of our experiences.
          </p>
          <p>Were I to suffer a terrible case of amnesia, I would remain "myself;" I would also contend that "myself" would be an amalgamation of all I have experienced up until my traumatic accident. So really, even if I don't remember my experiences, they are still there, and they still affect me. I don't remember much of my past but all of it has accumulated and results in who I am today.</p>
