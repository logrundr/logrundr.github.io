        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>Three or so years ago, I used to read stories online while listening to the same song on repeat for hours. Whenever I would read, I would always put on the same song. It was "Vincent" by Chet Atkins. Listening to that same song now brings back so many memories from that timeâ€”not just of me reading, but also of what was generally happening in my life three years ago. I don't listen to it much anymore because I want to preserve those memories. If I listen to it too much then I'll lose them.
          </p>
          <p>I know that I might have a tendency to romanticise the past, but I really do miss my life as it was. I'm not happy right now. However, there's nothing I can do about what's already done. I can only move on. Spending a life thinking about what <em>is</em> done, instead of what is <em>to be</em> done, is a waste of one. 
          </p>
          <p>With that thinking, I should be content with letting go of the past and thinking only about what's ahead. I should think about my future and how great it will be. One day, I will have a wife, who loves me, and a child, who loves me too. I will live in a big house and have a lot of money. I will have many friends. I will be an amateur in many fields and an expert in a few. That is the life that I want, and I should be thinking about working towards it instead of wasting my time thinking about what has already been done. Who cares about what is done? It's time to make something of myself. I can't do that if I waste my time reminiscing.
          </p>
          <p>The truth is that I love life, and I never want it to end. Even though I am still so young, the thought of life ending one day makes me question everything that I do. I know that I have many days left, but each one that I waste is one day fewer. It is as if I am slicing off time from my life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To live long, I will write in here, so that I never forget. <br>
            To live long, I will never waste a day. <br>
            I will make sure I remember. That is my promise. <br>
            To live <em>forever</em>, I will write in here <br>
            and I will record these entries <br>
            and I will leave it for someone to find. <br>
            To live forever is to not only remember but also be remembered.
          </p>
