          <p>Christmas Eve of 2020. It feels the same as any other day of the year.
          </p>
          <p>I was thinking recently about whether I would like to have children in the future. For a while I've wanted to one 
            day have two children—one boy and one girl. But should I even have kids at all? They ruin so much, and maybe I'd 
            rather spend all those years with my lover instead of raising children. 
          </p>
          <p>I had another thought after this one, and it was that it is selfish to not have any children. Well, at least my 
            reasoning behind it can be somewhat selfish. So maybe I should have one child. But then that child will be alone, 
            and what replacement can there be for the lifelong companionship of a sibling? Nonetheless, what does it matter if 
            my reasoning is selfish? If I would like to have no children, then I will have no children. 
          </p>

          <p>Life seems so boring... how can anyone possibly be happy? What is there to do? It's all the same. Everything is 
            the same, and it's all boring. What is the point of life anyway, if we are to die at the end of it? There is no 
            purpose, no meaning, no substance. I feel only emptiness. One of these days I will kill myself if happiness does 
            not find me. Perhaps there is nothing that can save me. Can love? I very much doubt it. Life means nothing—love 
            cannot fix that fact. 
          </p>
          <p>I've been disappointed by what life has to offer at every turn. When I was young and knew nothing, I thought that 
            life was exciting because I didn't know anything about it. Growing up and knowing more, I realise that humans are 
            very flawed creatures, and we were never meant to advance this far. We should've gone extinct long ago, or remained 
            as hunter gatherers. I think we would all be far happier if that were the case. Humans are not evolved to deal with 
            the stresses of modern society. I wish I could go back. Anywhere, any time, is better than here and now. I don't 
            care if I have to die to get there. I will get there nonetheless.
          </p>
          <p>I just want to be happy. I want to have a purpose. But that is not how life goes. It's easy to look at another 
            person and idolise them, because one can't see inside the mind of another, or within the life of another. Each 
            person has their own world, and within them they have their own flaws. It's hard to see that from our own. I 
            shouldn't focus on others. I shouldn't focus on myself. I should focus on nothing. Perhaps meditation would 
            soothe me. I just want to be happy.
          </p>
