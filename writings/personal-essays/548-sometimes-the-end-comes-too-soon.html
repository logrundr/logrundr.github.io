        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>My high school years were a strange blip within my life. That isn't to say that I don't appreciate those years: I recognise that 
            they were very important in developing who I am today (and have yet to become). But that is exactly why I say that they are a 
            blip, and why I don't like my high school self: I was developing, and didn't know who I was, so as a result I was strange and 
            awkward and all of these things that I'd rather not be.
          </p>
          <p>I'm glad that that phase seems to mostly be over. They were a key part of my development physically, mentally, emotionally, 
            creatively, and in every other possible category. Without my "awkward phase" I would be an utterly boring person, but I also 
            prefer not to think about it.
          </p>
          <p>My middle school years were much quieter and more innocent.
          </p>
          <p>In middle school I was myself, and I never felt that I needed to change. When I was young there was always a sense that I had 
            all the time in the world because I was still young and I was still in my childhood. My childhood is gone now! It's in the past, 
            never to be relived again.
          </p>
          <p>I can see why reincarnation is an appealing concept to humans—especially to ones like me that are nostalgic and wish to do things 
            over, not because I feel that I can do things better (although I might be able to) but because I just want to relive all of my 
            formative experiences that I have such strong nostalgia and sentimental value for. I wish that I could relive them. I know that's 
            not exactly what reincarnation is, though.
          </p>
          <p>Sometimes I wish that I could live those years for ever—it's not possible. Everything comes to an end. Those few years only lasted 
            for the same amount of time, and if I was to go back in time, I would eventually outgrow them too. It's impossible to stay in the 
            same spot. Time is always moving, our experiences are always changing... maybe I should start viewing that as a good thing rather 
            than a bad one. Humans seem to have a negative view towards change in general, and I'm not excluded from that.
          </p>
          <p>And now my high school years are gone too, and I am sure that I will feel nostalgic for those soon (I actually already am), 
            even though there is nothing to be nostalgic for. My high school years were the absolute worst years of my life, 10th grade 
            especially. There was some good in the bad which helped me through it, but there is no denying that 10th grade was the absolute 
            low point of my depression. 
          </p>
          <p>This journal was my vice. I wrote in it religiously in 10th grade. It helped me organise myself and realise who I was. If 
            only I had started writing in here earlier maybe I would have realised sooner.
          </p>
          <p>So I've started a new journey in life. I'm a college student now—I have been for nearly two years, but only just now am I becoming 
            an in-person student. I've become a completely new person than the one I was four years ago—that person that I was is now just 
            a distant memory, and a complete stranger to me, and it's hard to imagine that I ever was them in the first place. 
          </p>
          <p>Life is a series of changes and replacements, and if you remain the same person for your whole life, then you never really 
            lived—that's something that I need to realise. I cling to my past too strongly. I need to let go and let it drift away. I 
            need to let myself move on. I need to let myself change.
          </p>
          <p>Endings are always deliberate. The Universe has a plan. Nothing is on accident. There have been many endings within my life. 
            There have also been many beginnings. I am within a new beginning right now.
          </p>
          <p>There have been times in my life that I felt that the end came too soon. I felt it after {my first girlfriend} broke up with me. 
            I felt it during my 8th grade graduation. I felt it when the pandemic cut my senior year short.
          </p>
          <p>But there is something invigorating about having a new beginning; about starting fresh and having a clean canvas; about being 
            able to do whatever you want, because now you are free from your past self.
          </p>
          <p>Endings are never on accident.</p>
