        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>It feels like I've been 19 for a long time. The past year had me doing a lot of things which I've never done before, 
            so that it feels like I've lived a few years in the span of only one. To me high school feels like so long ago; it feels 
            like an entirely different life.
          </p>
          <p>I remember all of the people in high school, who were such central characters within my life and now feel miles away. 
            And most of all I remember myself, and how I was so hesitant to change. When the pandemic hit and suddenly my senior 
            year and my high school experience was abruptly over, I realised that I could change myself and I did. Maybe that was 
            part of the reason why Belinda broke up with me. I think I have massively changed myself for the better. Of course my 
            growing is not over yet—I will never be done growing. To me the sign of a good life is one in which you are always 
            recognising areas where you can improve and are actively working on improving.
          </p>
          <p>In less than a month I will be turning 20. I think I will call my 19th year my "Inner Spiritual Year", since I 
            thought about the meaning of life and what I want my purpose to be. I thought about my plan for life.
          </p>
          <p>If my 19th year is my Inner Spiritual Year, then my 18th was definitely my year of Development, and my 17th was the 
            year of Growth. 
          </p>
          <p>My 17th year was when I started dating {my second girlfriend}, and it was then that I made my first real musical 
            compositions for her birthday on April 12, 2020. That date marked the beginning of a boom in my musical creativity 
            and growth, and also sparked in me a kind of creative curiosity which has never ceased since that day. For that I 
            have her to thank, and myself for coming up with the idea of doing that for her birthday. 
          </p>
          <p>I conceptualised many of my projects when I was 17, like my language and calendars and time systems. When I was 
            18 I developed those much further, finishing a few but ultimately leaving many still unfinished. Many are unfinished 
            to this day as well.
          </p>
          <p>During my time being 19, I've moved to my own apartment, gained more independence, learned how to live on my own 
            (somewhat), and done a lot of thinking about my personality, my ideals, my values, my spirituality, etc. Even though 
            my entries in this journal have been few and far between in the last year, I think the quality is exactly where I 
            want it to be, with each entry bringing a completely new and fresh topic, and me writing good and insightful ideas. 
            I would definitely like to write more often though, if I come up with good ideas and find the time to do it. 
          </p>
          <p>I think I would like to intersperse some more mundane everyday experiences inbetween the deeper more conceptual type 
            of writings—sort of like I did in entry 549, which wasn't exactly an "everyday" experience but it was a retelling of 
            my day, which I feel I need to do more often and I'm a bit out of practice of doing.
          </p>
          <p>I would also like to write more personal entries again, since I feel that a lot of my entries recently have been 
            philosophical writings which aren't necessarily about my life or are only slightly related to my life, which is the 
            opposite of what this journal was originally intended for, but I definitely don't dislike the philosophical entries—I 
            actually really enjoy them, they are some of my favorites.
          </p>
          <p>Anyway, soon I will be 20 and I will have a new year ahead of me. I wonder what I will call my 20th year when I am 
            nearing 21.
