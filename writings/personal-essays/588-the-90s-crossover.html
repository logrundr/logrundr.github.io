          <p>Last night I had an idea. As you can tell from the end of my last entry, I'm ready for a change in my style. Well, I figured 
            why not use the clothes I already have? Last quarter I was wearing only my Victorian stuff, and I got more Victorian stuff for 
            the purpose of dressing that way, but I also have quite a few polo shirts and 90s knit sweaters that have gone unworn for about 
            a year. And I got rid of all of my old pairs of pants recently, so now I only have my high-waisted, suspendered Victorian pairs. 
            That's fine, though—I had the idea to simply combine the old with the new. I've created the style of the 90s crossover.
          </p>
          <p>The 90s crossover is what it sounds like: a crossover between the 1890s and the 1990s. Two "90s" from different eras.
          </p>

              <div class="column">
                <img src="images/588-B-DSCF0166.jpg" alt="90s crossover example" width="60%" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:5px solid #ececec">

            </div>
          </div>

          <p>I think I'll be leaning into this style quite heavily depending on how I like it over the coming weeks. I'll get some clothes 
            over this quarter that will help me with this style, although I can already put together a fair number of outfits. I think I 
            would do well to get some beanies, cardigans, turtlenecks, etc.
          </p>
          <p>My first impression upon putting together two outfits last night was that I look a lot better. The style just suits my face way 
            more, especially my hair style—that's something that really stood out when I dressed Victorian; my hair style just could never 
            match the Victorian style, and I wasn't sure if I even wanted it to. Yesterday when I was on campus I experimented with having 
            my hair pushed back rather than in bangs over my forehead, but I just don't think it worked. I think I was starting to realise 
            that the Victorian style was beginning to come into conflict with what I was changing into. So now, with these new realisations, 
            I have invented the 90s crossover style.
          </p>
          <p>Also, one of the reasons that I've decided to change (besides for my own sake), was because I felt like people treated me 
            like an outsider. They complimented my outfits every day, but it felt like I was treated more like an oddity than another person.
          </p>
          <p>And yes, this style is in part because I want to impress {my friend}. I don't want her to see me as an oddity too. Mostly, though, 
            this style is for myself; it's to bring what I'm feeling in my mind more in line with how I present myself to other people. I was 
            getting sick of all the Victorian and the old fashion and the strictness and the uptightness and the prudeness and the niceties 
            and the politeness and the museumness and the costumeness.
