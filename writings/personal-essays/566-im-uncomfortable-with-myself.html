        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I feel like I am so far behind everyone else: I have no friends, I don't go to clubs, I'm entirely a recluse, I have no 
            girlfriend, I can't cook, I can't do anything independently, and my personality didn't start to really develop until the 
            very end of high school, which seems very late compared to everyone else. There's this overwhelming sense that I'm not the 
            right person for myself. I'm not comfortable with how I am or who I amâ€”not yet, at least. I want to be a different person. 
            I want to be more social, and more charming, and have more hobbies, and be more driven and motivated.
          </p>
          <p>At the same time I feel disconnected from reality. I go to class every day and I don't even remember going; I play piano and it 
            feels like it's not my hands which are playing but someone else's; I think about asking out a girl that I have a crush on and it 
            feels like I'm in a dream and that it could never be reality. Anything that I think about feels like a dream, even if it actually 
            happened.
          </p>
          <p>How do I change myself? How do I make myself better?
          </p>
          <p>I want to be a better person, but I don't know exactly who and I don't know how to get there. All I know is that I'm uncomfortable 
            being myself and I'm tired of it.
          </p>
          <p>Here is a quatrain which I wrote today:
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%"><em>
            <strong>Quatrain III </strong><br>
            All things have their end and are born again,<br>
            so wishing you were young is an undoing.<br>
            To waste all your life is the sin of man,<br>
            so love your Self in happiness pursuing.
          </em></p>
          <p><em>[... paragraph omitted ...]</em></p>
          <p>Ideally, love would come to me. But knowing life, I think I will have to go find it.</p>
