          <h3>My Continuing Story</h3>
          <p>Life goes on and what is the now becomes memories within me. And I can't be sure of anybody else. The only thing that I'm sure of is that I exist, or, at the very least, that my conscience exists. It's so strange to think that one day, before I even know it, I'll be out of college, married, and raising kids. How far away is that, I wonder? And as life goes on, all of my experiences fade away and it's only the now that I can be sure of. Only the now. Everything else is uncertain or within my memories, and we all know that memories can only convince yourself. 
          </p>
          <p>One day I'll be an old man—or perhaps I will never live that far along—and I'll think about my past experiences. I'll <em>wonder</em> about them. Did they ever happen? How much is real and how much is fiction? 
          </p>
          <p>The only thing I can be sure of is now, but what even is <em>now</em>?
          </p>

          <h3>The Now</h3>
          <p>How could I be sure that my brain isn't fabricating information that I witnessed not only a second before. The <em>now</em> is only a split second in time. Not even a fragment of time really. It's unknowable. It's an infinitely small point that we are always progressing along. The small sliver of time that we can be absolutely 100% sure of, but it quickly goes away onto the next fragment. We only know what we see, and nothing else. But we humans sure do like to wonder. We wonder about everything: the past, the future, even the present. We wonder about the state of things, which stretches beyond the limits of time. 
          </p>
          <p>The brain is curious. It wants to know how things will turn out in the end. I've told myself many times that everything will turn out fine, and so far it has. Not everything has gone to plan exactly how I wanted, but it all somehow works out in the end. For some things I'm not quite sure how. Like when my second girlfriend (at the time just a crush) came up to me and told me that she liked me. What are the chances of that? How could I have known that? Did I only like her because I sensed that she might have feelings for me? Unknowable. It all worked out. Was I lucky? I always seem to get very lucky, with anything that I do. Just today I took an AP Exam for Government and Politics, and one of the prompts was almost exactly an issue that I addressed in my Senior Ex paper. What are the chances that something like that would pop up? It was a prompt about whether the government should put more emphasis on protecting individual liberties, or establishing order. Basically freedom versus control. Which was in my Senior Ex conclusion. Seems like a sort of strange thing to be in an exam for a class that hardly focused on that aspect at all. It mostly focused on the legislative process. The point is, I'm lucky. I don't know where I'm getting all of this luck from, but I don't think I've ever had any bad luck. 
          </p>
          <p>One day my luck is going to run out.
          </p>

          <h3>The Future</h3>
          <p>What does the future hold for me? Am I really going to get married one day and have kids, or will I be a loner and live by myself until my eventual death? That's what I feel will happen. The latter, I mean. I'm just not a social type. I suppose I will find someone somehow. 
          </p>
          <p>I need to think about the distant future. The long-term. The rest of my life. In college I could have 500 girlfriends if I wanted to, but none of them would want to settle down with me. I just want someone to settle down with, and talk about everything with. I want someone that I can have conversations to in the way that I have conversations with pieces of paper whenever I write. I'm a good writer because I write every day. I better be a good writer after writing over 400 entries. I'm not a good talker since I seldom talk. I'm too scared to even talk to my friends over voice chat because I'm not used to using a mic. 
          </p>
          <p>Life is boring, isn't it? You get a boring job that you don't like but you still spend the majority of your time at, then you come home to your wife who you stopped loving years ago—you're more like roommates now—and take care of your kids who never give you peace of mind. When does it ever end? The monotony? When does it get interesting? I want to love life. I want to love myself. The future doesn't seem promising, however.

          <h3>Not Alone and Not Forgotten</h3>
          <p>
            I'm not alone; I have someone.<br>
            I'm not forgotten; I have myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will not be alone; I will have someone.<br>
            I will not be forgotten; I will have memories.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was never alone; I always had myself.<br>
            I was never forgotten; I always had rememberers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being alone is impossible; the conscious mind knows.<br>
            Being forgotten is impossible; the universe knows.
          </p>

          <h3>—and After</h3>
          <p>
            Memories<br>
            only convince yourself
          </p>
          <p>
            What future?<br>
            Life is only my own
          </p>
