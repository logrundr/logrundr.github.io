        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I think most people have no concept of what love really should be. I think that most people end up "settling" for someone 
            lesser than what they know they really need. They feel pressured to get into a relationship and start a family, and so they 
            marry someone who doesn't really make them happy in the right ways or at all, and they start a family with someone they 
            don't truly love.
          </p>
          <p>I don't want to settle for anyone less than perfect for me; and maybe everyone doesn't want to settle either, but they end 
            up caving and doing it again; and maybe I will be the same way and I will settle one day too, but I don't want to.
          </p>
          <p>Surely, out of everyone in the world, there must be at least a few who I could call "perfect" for me. The problem is where 
            are they? They might be on the other side of the world, and I would have no chance of ever finding them. And have they already 
            settled for someone, so that even if I do find them, I would never have a chance with them? It's a serious problem of needing 
            to show up at the right place and the right time—the odds of such a thing occurring are extremely low, so I guess I can 
            understand why someone might want to settle for someone else.
          </p>
          <p>I think everyone deserves love, but people don't really know what love is. I don't know what love is, but I think I will know 
            love when I find it. I have thought in the past that I have experienced love, but I now feel that I never have. What I had with 
            {my first girlfriend} was simply a friendship taken a bit further. What I had with {my second girlfriend} was not love at all, just a 
            short-lived infatuation.
          </p>
          <p>What I am discussing is the issue of "soul-mates", which obviously don't exist from a physics perspective, and the prospect 
            of soul-mates existing is pure fantasy, not to mention extremely human-centric. I find that many kinds of spiritual thinking 
            are human-centric and ignore most of physics and astrophysics. But, I believe that rather than soul-mates, there exists 
            statistically someone which would complement me and I complement her.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>There are ultimately two kinds of love: a forced love, and a natural love. 
          </p>
          <p>A forced love is what I was calling "settling", where you settle for someone who you know is not truly for you, and who you 
            don't truly love and who doesn't truly love you. It's when you force yourself to try to love someone and you force yourself 
            into a relationship despite a lack of real connection. I think that most relationships are of this type—most people never 
            feel true love.
          </p>
          <p>A natural love is "soul-mates", or just like I was saying, the person who complements you and you complement them, and who 
            should statistically exist. It is the kind of love where you know right away that you love them, because everything about 
            them is immediately perfect (in your perception); no matter how much more you get to know them you still love them just as much 
            and they are just as perfect.
          </p>
          <p>Natural love exists. Most people never find it. I want to find it someday. She exists somewhere.</p>
