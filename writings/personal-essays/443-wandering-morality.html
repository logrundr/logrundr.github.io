          <h3>Wandering</h3>
          <p>There's this weird feeling that I've had for the past few days which is like, "Where am I?" I feel so lost and outside 
            of myself. I don't feel like a person anymore. Like I've entered No Man's Land, and it feels terrible to be here. 
            How do I make my way back?
          </p>
          <p>How will I ever get over myself! I just want to fall in love... I want to fall in love, get married, a nice job, 
            buy a beautiful house, furnish it however I want... I wonder if I will get any of those things? It's true that a few 
            years ago, I hadn't even thought that I would still be alive at this point. I had thought that I was going to kill 
            myself long before I reached college, but here I am! In another few years, it's impossible to say where I will be. 
            Hopefully living my best life as my best self, but that is only hopefully—realistically I will be as unhappy as ever! 
            With none to tell of my problems, because I will have given up on love long before (maybe it's already happened). 
          </p>
          <p>With {my second girlfriend} being such a recent aspect of my life, and the breakup being as sudden as it was, it makes me feel like 
            everything is going to be that way—that I will spend a long time building something nice (and I might have doubts along 
            the way, but I pull through) only to have it topple down at the last minute and when I'm in my weakest state. I can 
            imagine that happening to everything in my life...
          </p>
          <p>I want a purpose in life. I want something to attach myself onto and feel like I have a something I'm meant to be 
            doing. I don't like wandering. I don't like not knowing what to do... being lost, confused, unsure... but sometimes 
            it's nice to get a feeling like that every once in a while, to be reminded that those are things that I'm still 
            capable of feeling.
          </p>

          <h3>How do people come to be?</h3>
          <p>How do people become the people that they are? What sorts of factors lead someone down a certain path, and what 
            can someone do to influence it? Do people really have complete control over their own lives, or does outside 
            influence play a larger role than most people would like it to? I think a lot of our thoughts are not our own—they are 
            an amalgamation of many other people's thoughts and experiences. Of course, our own experiences influence our thoughts 
            more than hearing someone else's, and that's because we lived through it first-hand.
          </p>

          <h3>Within us all is a lot of love</h3>
          <p>I think people do bad things because they are ignorant and don't understand their actions. Stalin once said that one 
            death is a tragedy, but a million is a statistic. It is so applicable to people's feelings towards animals as well: 
            the death of their pet is tragic, but killing billions of land animals and <em>trillions</em> of fish per year is just a statistic. 
            They don't care as long as they don't have an emotional attachment to the animal. So many of people's "logical" 
            arguments against veganism sound absolutely terrible if applied to other things. They can all be dismantled within 
            ten seconds of thinking about it, but after all, these arguments aren't meant to make any sense—they are only meant 
            to make themselves feel better about eating meat. I'm sure that deep down, people realise that their arguments don't 
            make sense, but they ignore that too. 
          </p>
          <p>Does that make those people bad? Probably. Do they have good intentions? Some of them do, but it doesn't matter 
            if it means that animals are getting killed. 
          </p>
          <p>I don't understand how people can make such awful life choices without feeling extremely shameful and guilty. They 
            know that it's wrong but do it anyway. Why does {my sister} tell me that she feels bad about eating animals and wants to go 
            vegetarian, but today she still eats animals and hasn't been vegetarian for more than a day? I also tell her that 
            vegetarianism is still unethical, and she should go vegan. She tells me that it's "too difficult". More excuses! It 
            was one of the easiest things I've ever done! It also seems that every meat eater becomes a dietitian as soon as veganism 
            is brought up. They say that vegan food is unhealthy or that there's not enough variety, but they fail to review their 
            own diet and see that what they're criticising is actually part of what they eat, not vegans. It's a projection. 
          </p>
          <p>I had wanted to tell {my second girlfriend} of all of this, but I didn't want to hurt her, because that hurt would 
            be tangible and visible to me—the pain of the animals is hidden and obscured. I should have told her anyway. It is 
            my duty to speak for the animals because they cannot speak for themselves. I should have talked to her. She actually 
            seemed pretty open about it, and if I remember correctly, she even accepted for me to help her go vegan in college. 
            Obviously those plans will never come to fruition.
          </p>
          <p>People have good intentions, but that means something different within different minds. Is there an objective 
            morality to test everything against?
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>The Test of Morality</h3>
          <p>Some researchers on morality say that there are five main areas of morality: harm, fairness, community 
            (group loyalty), authority, and purity. In my own morals, what do I value most and what the least? I would 
            say that I value harm (reduction of harm), fairness, and purity. Community and authority are not very important 
            to me, but since they are important to society, I still have to follow some things. My moral values are reflected 
            in some of my lifestyle choices. The most notable one would be veganism I think. That is primarily harm and purity, 
            but the rights of animals could also be fairness.
          </p>
          <p>None of that is objective. Those are my own morals. Maybe there is nothing objective to test anything against, 
            especially morals. Whatever is most agreed upon by society is considered "objective" when really it's just a 
            collective opinion. Whatever works, I guess.
