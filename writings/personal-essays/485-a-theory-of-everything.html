          <p>Can our actions be determined by a Theory of Everything, as is the goal of physics? Rephrased: do we have free will? This might at first appear to be a philosophical question, but I believe it to be a physics one.
          </p>
          <p>My first thought when coming upon this question, is that a Theory of Everything would only be applicable for non-living bodies, like a planet or an atom, and not a living being. However, living beings are also composed of atoms, and it would make sense if an ultimate theory was able to describe and predict our own movements.
          </p>
          <p>Our brains are only made of neurons, and they operate somewhat like a computer. It's very complicated whether or not we can make a decision that influences the actions of this computer, or if it only <em>seems</em> that we can make decisions.
          </p>
          <p>If our actions can indeed be predicted, then it would mean that our fate was determined. It would mean that our discovery of this great theory has also been determined to happen or not. My entire life has already happened and I just don't know how it will play out yet—the concept seems ridiculous! Would it mean that no one is really truly "alive"? Because, to me, being alive means to be sentient and able to make decisions.
          </p>
          <p>Maybe the concept isn't very interesting when considering the idea that time might not exist. 
          </p>
          <p>I've written about the possibility that the universe has been here forever, and I also firmly believe that the universe is infinite in scope, in every direction and scale (there is always an infinitely smaller particle, and vice versa)—but are these two beliefs in agreement with each other? 
          </p>
          <p>If the universe was infinite in scope, and also in time, then it should mean that we would be able to see every existing star and particle within our night sky, but that isn't the case... instead, our view is limited to what's called the <em>Observable Universe</em>, which is restricted by how fast light can travel, since the light from bodies that are very far away won't have been able to reach us in the time since the creation of the universe. Now, this could prove either that the universe was created at some point, or that the entire universe is <em>only</em> our observable universe. Along with another observation—that anywhere we look, bodies seem to be moving away from us (suggesting expansion of the universe; in other words, there must be a center if it's expanding)—it makes more sense to conclude that the universe was created, and that the universe is <em>probably</em> infinite (and I definitely believe it to be so).
          </p>
          <p>So, the universe was at one point created, or at least <em>recreated</em>, since there are theories that the universe expands and then contracts again, and then repeats the cycle—not dissimilar to Aristotle's idea that human civilisation had been around for forever, but our progress was periodically wiped away from great floods or disasters and made to start over.</p>
