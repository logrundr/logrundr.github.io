          <p>I know it's been a while since I've last written. I just spent 8 hours today reading a book from start to finish, cover to cover, and am in a sort of mood now that can only happen after you're done reading a good book. It's a sort of wistfulness and regret that I feel because I don't live in their world, and I never will. It makes me feel sad that my world is so plain and boring, and theirs is so exciting and mysterious.
          </p>
          <p>My life will never be as thrilling as the characters within a book. I think that someday I would like to write my own novels.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>I'm just now coming out of the Dark Ages of my life, which I would say comprised late-7th grade up to a bit beyond the end of 12th grade—essentially, starting at my breakup with my first girlfriend and ending at my breakup with my second.
          </p>
          <p>She was there for me during my Dark Ages, and for that I am grateful. She helped me through it somehow, even though I know that she never meant to.
          </p>
          <p>My Golden Ages were from 5th grade up until 7th grade. Those were the best years of my life in many ways, and I will never be able to get it back—not anything. There are certain feelings and emotions that surround those years that I suspect I will never feel again. It's simply a period of my life that has now passed, but I can still vaguely relive it through my own memories, however accurate they may be.
          </p>
          <p>It's the same way for my Dark Ages. I occasionally dipped very low... to the point of wanting to end my life at several moments. I think that time has gone now, too. I would certainly hope that it has, but it has made up a considerable portion of my short life so far, and because of that, it has affected me in ways that I am still living today, if only because I only came out of it a year ago. 
          </p>
          <p>It is a coincidence that my best years were followed by my worst? Is it going to be a recurring pattern throughout my life that my highest highs are followed by my lowest lows? That a great period must be followed by a terrible one, as if by some kind of balance? Will I ever have years that I cannot classify as great or terrible, but simply as "mundane"—or is mundanity always assumed to be terrible?</p>
