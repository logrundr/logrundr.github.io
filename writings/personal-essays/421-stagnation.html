          <p>Time is relative.
          </p>
          <p>
            1 year is the equivalent to 20% of a 5 year old's life.<br>
            1 year is 5% of a 20 year old's life.<br>
            1 year is only 1.25% of a 80 year old's life.
          </p>
          <p>The more experience a person has in life, the less time a single experience is in the overall amount of time in their life. Take a fruit fly for example, a fruit fly on average will live 40 days. To a human, that seems like an extremely short amount of time. Imagine being born, growing up, finding a mate—living and dying... in just over a month. A fruit fly experiences time in a very different way than a human.
          </p>
          <p>That's part of it, but I'm starting to think it's not the whole picture, or even as big a part as we like to think. When we're kids every day is a new adventure. Monday is not Tuesday. Each day is different and new and exciting. We have discrete events to commit to memory that take up many discrete days. At the end of the year we can think back and remember 300 memorable days.
          </p>
          <p>In our teens we're getting into a routine, but we're still being forced to learn new things from time to time in school (though not as much as older me would have liked younger me to make the effort of doing). Life is still evolving in front of us. Monday of this week is not Tuesday of last week. Still new events from new days, but with more monotony filling in more between time. At the end of the year we can think back and remember 100 memorable days.
          </p>
          <p>In adult hood we've settled in. Monday of this week is not only Tuesday of last week, but It's Monday of three weeks ago and Tuesday of last year. Sure, we have weekends where we can hope to do something fun with friends or kids. At the end of the year we can think back and remember perhaps a dozen or so memorable days.
          </p>
          <p>If you want to slow time down a little bit, create more memorable days. Go on micro adventures. Do an activity you haven't done since you were 10. Break up the monotony.
          </p>
          <p>I used to feel that every day was a new one. I used to feel like I was being productive and doing things that I wanted to do every day. But I've stagnated. Every day is the same now. It's my regression into a former self—a self that wasn't creative, wasn't productive, wasn't anything. A self that was <em>nothing</em>.
          </p>
          <p>I write so I can remember. I write so my days are more memorable, and so I remember things. If I just have a passing thought then it's unlikely that I will remember, but something that I've written down is almost sure to stay in my mind for many years. I guess I'm creating my own sort of psuedo new experiences. Since each entry is different and unique, I can say that every day was a new experience, a new thought. In reality every day is monotonous and much of the same, but my entries don't entirely reflect that. That's what I like about writing, or any art. If I can look back and see my creations from this day or that day, then it makes me feel like each day was different.
