          <p>I don't want to die.
          </p>
          <p>I don't want to leave nothing behind. I ultimately want to change the world, or be a positive influence for people, but I don't want to leave nothing behind. In a way, that's why I write. So when I die people have something to remember me by. Maybe one day my kids will read through these entries, or they'll listen to the audio recordings of them that I will eventually make. Even if I don't change the world, and I don't do anything positive for humankind, I would still like to not be forgotten. I won't let people forget me easily. At least my kids will remember me and have something to remember me by. What about their kids? Will they remember me, even if they never met me? Will they listen to the audio recordings and read my entries? Will they listen to my music and be proud that I was their grandfather?
          </p>
          <p>I don't want to die. 
          </p>
          <p>Does God hate atheists? Does God care about us? Why would he? There is no motivation to. If I was a god, then I wouldn't care about anything. Why did he create heaven and the universe and the creatures? So he wasn't alone? 
          </p>
          <p>Will I go to heaven when I die? Will I go anywhere when I die?
          </p>
          <p>If God is real then do other civilisations exist? Others outside of Earth? I know religion usually centers around humans specifically, or if not that, then Earth. What if reincarnation could make you reincarnated on a completely different planet? What if when you die, your soul can travel off Earth and be stuck in space, searching for a civilisation that you could finally impart your soul onto. That would be how reincarnation on other planets would be possible.
          </p>
          <p>Could God have created more than just the creatures of Earth? Could God have been disappointed that Eve disobeyed Him? and that we killed His son? He would have left us and gone to do other things. A God has better things to do than deal with us humans.
          </p>
          <p>There has to be a reason why we haven't encountered any alien life. It's like we're in an empty city and we're the only house with a light. Maybe there's a reason all the lights are off.
          </p>
          <p>What's the point? The universe is so massive, and we're so small. Why do people care about anything? Is there a point to living? Think about the vastness of the universe, and no doubt all the other civilisations that exist. What makes us special? 
          </p>
          <p>If there are no advanced civilisations that can colonise other planets, then that would mean that most of them go extinct before reaching that level of technological advacement. Are humans doomed to extinction too? I think that we are. Humans tend to be quite bad at reading the future and acting accordingly. We don't think about the consequences of things. That's why there is hardly any action being taken to mitigate climate change. That's why people continue to eat meat, because they don't fully acknowledge that what they're eating was once a beautiful living creature.
          </p>
          <p>The incredible monstrousness of the universe makes life seem bleak and not worth living. There is nothing that will cause anyone to have any sort of impact on the universe. We are small. Maybe that's a good thing from certain viewpoints. It means that we can do whatever we want and not think of the consequences, which we already do.
          </p>
          <p>It may be so that I won't have any impact, but I won't be forgotten.
          </p>
          <p>Someday I will be dead, and the universe will continue on, just as it was when I wasn't here. It's strange that someday I won't be here anymore. I won't get to experience anything. And the world will keep going. How can consciousness just cease? I love living. I don't want to die. It's hard to imagine that a couple years ago I <em>wanted</em> to die. I suppose it's hard for the human brain to comprehend that we only get one shot at living, and it's not worth cutting it short. 
          </p>
          <p>There's so much to the universe. So many things that we can never understand. No one will ever know what it's like to be dead because there's no one here to tell us. Sure, there are people that have died and been revived shortly after, but do they really know what it's like to be dead? Do they? Or is it that their mind fills in that gap somehow, and makes it seem like they experienced something during that time. Gives them false memories. Nothing from the human brain is reliable information. You can only convince yourself. Your mind tells you you're sure of what you saw, even though the brain secretly isn't sure at all and is making up new memories all the time.
          </p>
          <p>So what is being dead really like? What is ceasing to think like? Should I be comforted knowing that I won't know I'm dead, or disturbed? 
          </p>
          <p>There is no point in believing in something without any evidence, and without any reason. There is reason to believe that alien civilisations exist, but no evidence. I believe that they exist. Maybe not in the form that humans usually think of them as.</p>
