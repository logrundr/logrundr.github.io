        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>Sometimes I am so exhausted. I don't feel like doing anything, but I still have obligations that need tending to. And I wish that I could leave society—put everything on hold, and just take a week vacation and come back like no time had passed at all. And resume my obligations as they were a week ago.
          </p>
          <p>But it's not possible to do such a thing. If I'm exhausted, then my obligations simply are ignored, no matter how important they are. Schoolwork that needs to get done? If I don't feel like doing it, I won't do it. Exams that need to be studied for? If I don't feel like studying, I won't do it.
          </p>
          <p>It's a type of extreme procrastination where things are put off to such an extent that they never get done. It stems from my fear of failure. In my mind, it's impossible for me to fail if I never confront my problems in the first place. It's an irrational idea, because the lack of confronting my problems is a failure in itself.
          </p>
          <p>I fear failure in all aspects of my life. It controls me. And my idea of what a failure is shapes all of it. To me, a failure is when I conform to everyone else—I want to be different. I want to be memorable even if I only say a single sentence. I want my words to be perfectly chosen. A failure is also when I stumble over my words, or get a bad grade on an exam, or when I feel that I didn't put enough effort into something (even if the result is satisfactory, it doesn't feel deserved).
          </p>
          <p>I also recognise how completely meaningless all of society, life, and the universe are. That fact makes me feel like I don't need to do anything. I don't owe anyone anything except myself the pleasure of leisure. I like working on my own personal projects, but being forced to do something by a certain deadline makes me freeze up and put it off until the last moment. Give me something interesting and I'll do it with passion.</p>
