        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>When I think back on what I would do differently in the past, and <em>especially</em> if I was able to go back in time with my current experiences and knowledge, it reminds me of how fragile my current situation is. What I mean by that is that there was a very specific set of circumstances that caused butterfly effects to land me exactly where I am today. If any of those circumstances were even <em>slightly changed</em>, my situation would be different. 
          </p>
          <p>The past cannot be changed. The only thing that can be done of your situation is to consider the future. It is important to recognise how past decisions have affected where you are now, but it is not important to dwell on what you would do differently for too long. Don't waste your time in your memories. 
          </p>
          <p>In fact, I do think of my future a lot. I like to think of my possiblities and what I'm capable of, and also what sort of pleasures I will have that I don't have now. It does make me feel strange that <em>this is it</em>â€”this is my entire life and when it's over, there will be nothing again. I won't have a chance to live as someone else, or have some sort of supernatural or afterlife experiences. No... this life is all that I have, and I have to come to terms with this Truth.
          </p>
          <p>In the context of that, it makes me wonder why people live at all. What reason does the universe have for existing? It could just as well have never existed at all, and then no one would ever live and suffer. What reason do humans have for existing? Or life in general? Is it just to reproduce? Or is there a broader purpose of observing the universe, because without life there would be nothing to experience the infinite bodies of the universe?
          </p>
          <p>I don't think that there is a purpose to anything. It's all a result of extremely unlikely butterfly effects. These butterfly effects are what drive the universe. In reality, I don't think that luck (or, as I said, likeliness) exists. Everything has some way of being predicted, or some degree of predictability, if all of the properties are known. If we can figure out everything of the universe, then it should allow us to predict the movements of all the neurons within our brains, and therefore allow us to predict our thoughts and our movements.
          </p>
          <p>In the context of that (again), why do people live at all if things can be predicted? And, if everything lives by some set of rules that can at all times be predicted with perfect accuracy at any point in the future, then does the present time mean anything at all? Perhaps not, but maybe the meaningfulness of the universe doesn't matter to humans.</p>
