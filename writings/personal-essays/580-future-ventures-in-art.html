          <h3>Action follows motivation, or motivation follows action?</h3>
          <p>Having the knowledge that I've gained a new friend has motivated me greatly to continue pursuing my 
            hobbies—to take things a bit more seriously—and to take the plunge into new hobbies that I've been <em>thinking</em> about starting for 
            a while but have yet to get the equipment or motivation for.
          </p>
          <p>I think I've had it somewhat backwards before. I used to think that motivation came before action—you wait for some motivation 
            or inspiration, and then you act on it and do what it tells you to. But, I've been feeling lately that action should come 
            <em>before</em> motivation—or, put another way: motivation follows action.
          </p>
          <p>That's what happened here, with my new friend. I acted on it first by passing her a note, and now I've got motivation to do all 
            of my hobbies again. It wasn't a moment of motivation which caused me to act; rather, it was bravery (or impulsion). I was brave 
            to pass her that note.
          </p>
          <p>I felt that it was necessary to pass her the note. I felt that I needed a change in my life—this wasn't a motivation, it was a 
            depression. It was an <em>impression</em>, rather. An impression that I got which told me it would be good to do something to better my 
            life, and I thought that if I didn't ask out her or anyone that I would regret it later, because I felt, and still feel, that 
            I'm throwing away my youth. I need to use my time wisely, because every day I get older, or, to say it backwards, every day my 
            youth depletes.
          </p>

          <h3>Video Photography</h3>
          <p>I want to get into photography. Specifically, I want a video camera that can take good quality photos, as well as videos 
            (with sound, if I attach a microphone to it).
          </p>
          <p>One afternoon, a few weeks ago, I was waiting for a bus on a rainy and foggy and dreary day, and I stood there under the shelter 
            of the canopy at the bus stop, gazing out at the falling droplets of rain, and listening to them hit the pavement, and listening 
            to cars drive past me, through that thick fog. And I thought to myself: "It would be nice to get a good recording of this."
          </p>
          <p>I thought that same thing again on another occasion, only this time it was nighttime, and I was again waiting for the bus, and 
            I looked up at the trees and their branches and leaves gently swaying in the wind gusts, and I heard the breezes. And I thought 
            to myself: "It would be nice to get a good recording of this."
          </p>
          <p>So, I want to get into what I'm going to call "video photography". I don't know if that term already exists—I haven't looked 
            into it. I want them to essentially be short video clips. I'll take normal photographs to accompany the scenes also, but there 
            will be also be these video clips which I call moving photos—or moving pictures, if you will, or even, movies.
          </p>
          <p>Yes, I know: it already exists. Taking short videos of artistic scenes isn't anything new. In fact, it's quite common in more 
            artistic video-taking, such as music videos or short shots in an actual movie.
          </p>
          <p>Nonetheless, I think I can enjoy partaking in something which already exists... I have this nagging thought in the back of my 
            head which tells me that I should try pursuing something entirely new, but I don't think such a thing is possible. It's simply 
            an abstraction in my head—an impossibility to bring into reality.
          </p>

          <h3>Branching out in Music</h3>
          <p>About every month I tend to switch the kind of music that I listen to. One month, it will be Baroque era keyboard music 
            (like Scarlatti's Sonatas); another, it will be psychedelic rock; another, it will be early 1900s country music; another, 
            it will be modern indie music; et cetera, et cetera...
          </p>
          <p>This past week, it changed to ambient music. The primary type of music which I <em>compose</em> has been what I call "meditation 
            music" (see <a href="519-a-description-of-my-music.html">entry 519</a>), but I never listened very deeply to that type of music. 
            And anyway, my meditation music was quite different from ambient music.
          </p>
          <p>I started listening to ambient music because of {my new friend}. During our picnic she played Boards of Canada. I listened to some 
            of that when I got home that night, and that led me down the path of ambient music. I've been "composing" (or rather, improvising) some 
            ambient music over the past week. I've already made 13 tracks. Most of them are, as would be expected from improvisations, not 
            all that great. There are a few which I like, and I might expand on them eventually. 
          </p>
          <p>I'd like to make a full-fledged track at some point, with percussion and multiple layers and things like that. I'd need to learn 
            how to produce music for that. I'd also like to take my new interest in poetry and connect it to music. I'd like to develop a 
            system for turning words into music using a method I'll term "musical prosody". I'd also like to try writing lyrics and 
            recording indie music, because I feel like that's the kind of music which I could see myself making the most. It just seems very "me".
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>Anyway, that's all for now. I have a final exam tomorrow which I need to do well on, so I'm going to get some sleep and study 
            for that in the morning. After that I have Spring break. I have so many ideas for new hobbies and new things that I want to get. 
            I'm going to have a lot of things to share with {my new friend} when we get back from Spring break.
          </p>
