          <p>I'm writing this from the courtyard of Baskin Engineering on campus.
          </p>

          <img src="images/587-A-DSCF0157.jpg" alt="Baskin Engineering courtyard" width="60%" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto" id="image-border">

          <p>I can't take anything in my life to be constant. Even the most fundamental of things, which I had thought were what built the 
            very core of my entire existence, can eventually change—it's only a matter of time. I had thought that I would be creating 
            things my whole life. I thought that creating was my life's purpose. I see now that I might be wrong. It's only the beginning 
            of an epiphany that I might grow to become more convinced of.
          </p>
          <p>In middle school I had thought that I would eventually marry my first girlfriend. I couldn't see myself being with anyone else 
            other than her. How very wrong I was—how naive.
          </p>
          <p>In high school I had thought that I would have long hair for the rest of my life. I was wrong about that too.
          </p>
          <p>I had thought that I was socially awkward. I am. But I thought that it would last forever. It won't. Everything will eventually 
            change—it's only a matter of time.
          </p>
          <p>And recently I was convinced that I would be dressing in the Victorian style for the rest of my life. I will be wrong about that 
            too; because it is evident—you can see it all around you—that change is always happening. It just takes a little bit of doubt to 
            sow a seed that eventually grows into unrest, which eventually turns into change.
          </p>
          <p>I have recently been in unrest about all aspects of my life. How do I make changes when I want to make changes to everything 
            all at once? I have to pick and choose something to focus on for a time before I can move on to the next thing that's bothering 
            me. I must've sowed my seeds of doubt during high school. They are now blossoming into raging, evil flowers of discontent and 
            unhappiness and self-doubt—a thorny and prickly and unsightly thing to behold—for the time being, that is. In a future time I 
            won't be so restless. I will be happier and free of doubt, and full of love too—it's only a matter of time.
          </p>
          <p>Last night I was full of doubt and unrest about where I'm going in my life, especially academically. There's not much I can do 
            to change things on that front. I just have to ride it out until I'm done. And when I am, maybe I will go back to school to start 
            things over. Maybe I can do things differently.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>I see now that life is all about love. I had it all wrong by focusing on my little projects. What does any of that matter? I 
            have to have someone to share it all with for me to truly enjoy it—someone to share my life with. That's not a change I can make 
            on my own. I have to find someone—it's only a matter of time, right...? ...... Right...?
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>I can be anybody that I want to be. There is no sticking to one person. I know that I can transform myself into anyone, given 
            enough time. That is the crux of life: there is never enough time to do everything. So you have to pick what you think is most 
            important and focus on that to the disregard of everything else. How can I choose what's important?
          </p>
          <p>When reading my philosophy books, I write my thoughts on binder paper and stick it in the relevant pages. One of the pages I 
            had written into Epictetus' Discourses said something along the lines of: If you respect someone, you will want to emulate them 
            and copy them in everything that you do. And if you don't want to emulate them, then you don't respect them.
          </p>
          <p>Well, what does it say about me when I am now thinking of changing the way I dress, and the way I style my hair [...]? What does it say 
            about me when I want to become {a new person}? [...] I don't want to always be the same person—that's what I'm coming to realise. 
            Some people, maybe even most, would be happy to remain the same for their entire life, but I don't want to be that way—not until 
            I'm perfect, which isn't achievable, so I guess I will remain a changer. Maybe that will change too.
          </p>
