          <p>Getting old scares me. Dying scares me.
          </p>
          <p>The idea that someday I will be older—middle aged, and elderly—scares me. The idea that my youth will be taken from me scares 
            me. It puts a time limit on everything. It tells me, "Hurry up! Do everything you want to do, and as soon as possible, and 
            never let your path steer away from your desires, because one day you will be too old to do anything, and another day still 
            you won't be here anymore. So hurry up, while you still have time. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry."
          </p>
          <p>There's no time to lose. Why do I waste so much time inside? I should be outside, enjoying myself, or doing something more 
            worthwhile. But instead, I waste my time inside, doing nothing and accomplishing nothing. Why am I so shy? Why have I wasted 
            so much time imagining a better life for myself, yet never taking action to make that fantasy into something real? Why did I 
            never realise my limited time? Why did I never realise that my youth will one day be gone, and I'll be old, and I won't be 
            able to go back to change things?
          </p>
          <p>Here's a relevant quatrain which I wrote on February 7th (included in entry 566):
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%"><em>
            <strong>Quatrain III </strong><br>
            All things have their end and are born again,<br>
            so wishing you were young is an undoing.<br>
            To waste all your life is the sin of man,<br>
            so love your Self in happiness pursuing.
          </em></p>
          <p>Yes, I have no time to lose. And when I'm old, there won't be any point in wasting even more time wishing I was younger. 
            There isn't any point in wishes at all—there is only point in action.
          </p>
          <p>Feeling this pressure to hurry and get as much as possible done before I die is a bit overwhelming. It makes me nervous that I 
            won't be able to live up to what I want. It makes me nervous that when I'm dying, I'll think back on everything and think of 
            what I could have done differently, and I'll regret everything. It makes me feel that I have to do everything right, right now, 
            and I can't mess anything up or my entire life will be ruined, and everyone knows you only get to live one life, so the entirety 
            of my existence—the entirety of everything I will ever experience, and know—will have been squandered of its true potential. Is 
            that Fate?
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>Here's something I wrote in the notes on my phone, sometime in Spring last year, probably while I was heading to my writing class:
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%"><em>
            How could it be that someday I will die? How could it be that life is so fragile? My life feels infinite; it feels so alive.
          </em></p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%"><em>
            Today I am alive, but someday I will be nothing.
          </em></p>
          <p>Seriously—how could it be that one day you won't be alive? Really think about it for a moment. What does it mean for you to be 
            dead? I'm sure right now you feel alive, but one day it won't be so—one day you won't be able to feel anything, because you won't 
            exist anymore.
          </p>
          <p>So does anything matter? No, not really. Making the most of your experience is the best that you can hope for, whatever that 
            means for you. And you should hurry about it, too. Don't let yourself get stuck in a place you don't want to be, because that's 
            more time wasted that could've gone to living. It's more time that you're wasting, while your youth is depleting. You're withering 
            away, and you're spending your time doing things you don't enjoy, talking to people you don't like, and never exploring your 
            possibilities. There's so many things to do. 
          </p>
          <p>I think I want to try everything at least once. And if ever I'm thinking about doing something, I should just do it, even if I'm 
            doubtful. If I feel like talking to some stranger I see on campus, I should go for it. If I feel like joining a club or going to 
            an event, I should go for it. If I feel like doing anything—anything at all—then it's an impression. The doubt is an opposite 
            impression—one which can be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>I need to act more on my impressions—good and bad. It will make me learn more. It will make me more human.</p>
