          <p>I think the reason for my sporadic writing recently is this: these entries were originally, and have been for a long time, used as a way to cope with my depression and other intrusive thoughts. It wasn't <em>always</em> used in that way, but I would say that the majority of my entries are like that. Now, I think that I feel better, or maybe my life is just too boring currently to have any intrusive thoughts. Either way, I don't have much to "cope" with anymore. I will not abandon this journal. I will never. All of this that I'm saying is just excuses.

          <p>Veganism is not a diet. I eat a plant-based diet because I am vegan. It is a set of morals—very basic morals—that make me vegan. The moral that killing is wrong, and that exploiting others for their detriment and your own gain is wrong. Does not the fifth commandment state "Thou shalt not kill"? Should not that extend to animals as well? But yet the Bible is interpreted as saying that we have allowance to exploit animals when God said that we have dominion over them. God only says that we are to eat the plants. To eat animals is a sin.

          <p>A couple of days ago I was in the shower and I noticed that there was a moth in the bathroom with me. I watched as he flew into the tub and the water started <em>disintegrating</em> his wings. I saw little pieces of his wings float down the water and into the drain as he struggled to fly away and out of the water. All that I could do was watch him because obviously I was covered in water so all I would do was hurt him more if I tried to pick him up. He soon stopped moving and went down the drain. I felt horrible.</p>
