        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>Nothing is permanent. Everything must eventually be reduced to memories, relegated to the past. The good things come 
            and go, and so do the bad things, and everything else too. It could be on a small scale, like friendships or jobs; or 
            it could be long term, like marriages, and even life.
          </p>
          <p>It's strange to think that one day my life will be over; my life is just as impermanent as the rest of the Universe. 
            And even that is a strange thought—how is it that the Universe is not some infinitely existing thing, always impermanent 
            in small areas but permanent as a whole? How is it that the <em>whole</em> Universe can be impermanent? One day it 
            will be reset, and everything will be done over again, perhaps differently than the time before it; I think that it 
            has already happened an infinite amount of times. And so, the Universe is just as impermanent on all scales.
          </p>
          <p>It's nice sometimes for me to think about the impermanence of things. If I'm feeling depressed, I tell myself "this 
            too shall pass", and I remind myself that in the future things will be better, or at the very least I can be sure that 
            they will be <em>different</em>.
          </p>
          <p>At the same time, thinking about impermanence can bring about a feeling larger than just depression—existential 
            dread. I will die one day, just as everyone does and everyone already lived has already done. My life will go through 
            constant change; it's impossible to imagine myself in ten years, let alone even five. 
          </p>
          <p>And one day, when I'm old, I will die. Maybe it won't even be when I'm old. Maybe I will die young; maybe I will die 
            sad and destitute; maybe I will die happy and loved; maybe I will die poor; maybe I will die rich; maybe I will die 
            painfully; maybe I will die painlessly. 
          </p>
          <p>It all doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that I will die—and if one day I die then how is there a 
            purpose to living? How does life have any meaning if it will one day end? How does the Universe have any meaning 
            if it will one day come to an end, and be reborn again?
          </p>
          <p>I think that everything and everyone is like the Universe—dying and being reborn. I think that when I die, I will be 
            the petals of a flower, and blades of grass in a meadow, and the wings of a butterfly; and one day those too will be 
            gone, and reborn as other things. And in that way, everyone lives infinite lives, their atoms being repurposed. My 
            atoms have been all around the Universe for infinity, but never gathering together to compose a being which made myself 
            until the moment I was born, and even then the atoms in my body come and go, so that even as I am living I am never 
            the same person twice, and I contain the atoms of all the people in the world, and all the animals in the world, and 
            every tree; and everybody is connected in the same way as that, so that all things and all life on Earth and perhaps 
            in all of the Universe is connected in some way, our shared atoms being used and repurposed and used again, even after 
            the Universe is reset and the parts of our beings are scattered again, but never reshaping to form exactly ourselves 
            again—and what atoms exactly would constitute "ourselves" when our atoms are always changing and we are always aging? 
            There is no single individual: we are all an infinite amount of people throughout our lives, our atoms changing, our 
            bodies aging, our personalities developing, our interests shifting, so that when we are eighty we are as different to 
            ourself at twenty than to anybody else.
          </p>
          <p>And so I think sometimes to myself, when I am at all feeling that it is appropriate: "this too shall pass", meaning 
            that the Universe is always changing, and as we are part of the Universe, we are always changing too, and the bad comes 
            and the good comes, and the bad goes and the good goes. And some things remain for longer than others, but there exists 
            no constants within the Universe, only constants in controlled systems for controlled timespans, so that throughout your 
            life you may say that there was a "constant"—perhaps you lived in the same house for all of your life, but even that 
            house is not the same as it was when you were born. Nothing is ever the same over time, even if it appears that way.
          </p>
          <p>This too shall pass. And be born again. As petals in a flower.
          </p>
