        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I have been thinking recently about taking a vow of silence. In doing so, I wondered if people had restricted themself 
            in other ways, particularly a vow of blindness.
          </p>
          <p>I could only find one example of a vow of blindness: in the Hindu epic the Mahabharata, Gandhari is the wife of a 
            blind king, and to live like him she wears a blindfold at all times. She made a vow to live blind to experience the 
            world as her husband does.
          </p>

          <br><img src="images/557-Gandhari_on_throne.jpg" alt="Gandhari on Throne" width="40%" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;border:5px solid #ececec"><br>

          <p>I wonder if I could do a vow of blindness, just to see what life is like as a blind person—and also to appreciate 
            what I have more, which is really the idea behind all vows including silence. Even crossing the street seems like 
            an impossible and very dangerous task. And what about sidewalks? In my town the sidewalks abruptly end and start 
            again, so I'd have to be walking in the middle of the road completely blind, navigating around parked cars and such.
          </p>
          <p>How is such a thing possible? Still, despite the feeling that its impossible, or maybe because of it, I've been 
            considering the idea of a vow of blindness. Even just for a single day would be very difficult.
          </p>
          <p>A vow of silence is much closer within my reach, and very doable for just about anyone. The goal is to make you 
            appreciate communication more, but also think deeper about what it is that people usually talk about that you are 
            depriving yourself of. I think if I was to do a vow of silence, I would probably find that most conversation is 
            pretty pointless in the big picture.
          </p>
          <p>Silence is something I am already good at. In one-on-one conversation, I can talk quite a bit if the topic is 
            interesting or if I like the person or if they're asking a lot of good questions; but in group conversations, I'm 
            almost entirely silent because most people seem to enjoy talking over each other and butting awkwardly into the 
            conversation so that there are zero gaps where I would be able to say anything.
          </p>
          <p>Also, I get the impression that many people like to talk just to hear their own voice, just so they can say 
            something; whereas I like to talk when I have something meaningful to add to a conversation. That's how I like 
            to think about it anyway, but in reality that's probably just a way of explaining my social anxiety. A vow of 
            silence would only make my social anxiety worse, because I would get used to being completely in the background 
            and not contributing at all to conversations. It would be a disaster if, say, I was silent for a year, because then 
            when the year was up I may never desire to talk again.
          </p>
          <p>And maybe I shouldn't desire to talk. Maybe speech is pointless—a tool which weakly conveys what can be much better 
            said in other mediums: body language, pictures, music, etc. Maybe the true purpose of a vow of silence is to find these 
            nonverbal ways of communication.</p>
