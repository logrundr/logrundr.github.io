          <p>The mind is often separated only in two states: conscious and subconscious. But it can be found, purely by being alive and experiencing the mind, that there are many layers within both states, and in fact what we consider as the two states of the mind are really just the vessels of many layers that live within them.
          </p>
          <p>The conscious mind has multiple layers, and at any point these layers may individually be in several different and distinct states. This can be called multi-tasking, and from my own experience I would say that it's very difficult to do on purpose. There is one layer in the forefront, which I will call the Principal Layer, and which serves as what most people call the conscious mind, where willful thoughts (assuming that will exists, but in this case I say it even if it's an illusion) are created and are displayed with the most clearness above the noise of the other layers. 
          </p>
          <p>The background layers behind this principal layer are the thoughts which are automatic and unwillful, and which can sometimes be highlighted in a manner similar to the principal layer, in which attention is brought to it. These background layers are especially present when the mind is left to wander; it's when more focus and attention is spent on the principal layer that the background layers fall further into the background and lose their grasp on the mind.
          </p>
          <p>The background layers influence the principal layer. The background layers can almost be thought of as filters, through which thoughts pass and are then "approved" to be within the principal layer. Of course, all of this happens very quickly, and it is so automatic that we do not even notice that it's happening, save for rare occasions.
          </p>
          <p>The background layers are the most real and visceral depiction of the true self, where the principal layer often only shows what we would like to think of ourselves as. Learning to meditate, and to let the mind wander so as to allow the background layers to take control over the principal layer, is the true way to learn oneself. This is the purpose of meditation.
          </p>
          <p>The subconscious mind has the same system of layers, although it is much more difficult to measure and to control, given that one has no power over the subconscious. The subconscious consists of the layers most in the background, where the conscious mind does not even notice them.
          </p>
          <p>Tell yourself to be quiet. Listen to what happens when you are not thinking. There is more to the mind than you know, and there is more to yourself than you think.</p>
