          <p>Life is so short, but at the same time it feels very long. I have many things that I still want to do, but it also 
            feels that my life is done. It feels like I have lived forever already, and that I don't need to live any further. 
            My life feels very long already. 
          </p>
          <p>Still, there are many things that I haven't done. There are many things I still want to do. I have all of my projects 
            that I would like to work on. I have been thinking recently of the Universe, and how it must be that there is a purpose 
            to everything. I do not think that anything is random. The Universe has structure to it—it is obvious, and observable, 
            and intuitive to any living thing. Many ideas of human construction can be traced back to a Universe. It is an 
            intuitive, but many don't realise it.
          </p>
          <p>Does the Universe actively control us? I think not—rather, it has already written everything that will happen. It 
            even so happens, that the Universe intended for me to write this very entry describing it. 
          </p>
          <p>I think strongly that fate does exist, and that everything is predetermined under the laws of the Universe, and also 
            by the interactions of things around it, otherwise known as cause and effect. Although, the laws of the Universe are 
            what dictate the causes and effects of things. The Universe controls everything passively, in that it wrote the laws, 
            but does not actively control anything. And when it wrote the laws, did it experience everything at once?
          </p>
          <p>Well, of course, saying that the Universe "wrote" anything is a completely human idea. It is only used to describe 
            something that humans can't comprehend. The Universe did not create itself. I have written before that the Universe 
            has existed for eternity. There is no beginning.
          </p>
          <p>I am saying here that the Universe has given every life reason for existing. The only reason for existing is that 
            the laws of the Universe have determined that we are to exist. 
          </p>
          <p>And, in comparison with the eternal existence of the Universe, human existence is very small. I am only here for a 
            short time—in fact, no time at all—but it seems much longer to the mind. 
          </p>
          <p>Humans can never comprehend the laws of the Universe. But, we can make an attempt to simplify them. I believe that 
            one of the principle axioms of the Universe is that everything takes the most efficient path. Does this imply that 
            particles are capable of calculation? I simply think it means that things inherently "know" what path to take. I 
            think it is perhaps this idea that is the fundamental idea for all other axioms of the Universe.
          </p>
          <p>And of course, one of the most famous axioms is that matter cannot be created or destroyed. It is nonsensical to 
            say that matter can be created from nothing, and also to say that matter can be destroyed; because to say matter can 
            be destroyed is to say that particles can be made to vanish, with no trace left. It isn't possible. Everything is made 
            of energies, and when a matter is "destroyed", it is actually broken into its fundamental energies.
          </p>
          <p>This axiom follows the rule that things take the most efficient path. If a matter is to be "destroyed", it is least 
            expensive to break apart rather than resist.
          </p>
          <p>What other axioms are there? I can't say at the moment.</p>
