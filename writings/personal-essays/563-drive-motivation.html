          <p>I think my mind has gone dumb after so long without writing, and without doing anything of any worth.

          <h3>Drive and Motivation</h3>
          <p>Motivation results from a reason to do something, which is usually a short-lived burst of energy. Drive is the ability to do 
            something regularly, even when you don't feel like doing it.
          </p>
          <p>Drive is the result of self discipline.
          </p>
          <p>I feel that I have neither of them and haven't for a long time, especially drive. Have I ever felt <em>drive</em> to do something, or 
            was it only a short-lived motivation?
          </p>
          <p>Have the will and drive to create things is the most important aspect of someone. Creating things is the sole purpose of humans 
            on this Earth. It doesn't even necessarily have to be creating art—it could be creating relationships, or something more abstract 
            like that. Nonetheless, what ever it may be, creating things is the goal of all humans. 
          </p>
          <p>If someone is not creating, then they are not living. They have no purpose, and to them, death is the same as life. Because if 
            you are not creating, and therefore not living the goal of a human, then how is it different from death? Both are not human.
          </p>

          <h3>What was, and what is, and what's not</h3>
          <p>I think as a society we should stop valuing so much of <em>what was</em>, and instead value <em>what is</em>. Meaning, we shouldn't 
            put so much weight on telling stories, we should focus on ideas, emotion, and what we feel in the moment. Telling stories focuses on 
            the past, it focuses on <em>what was</em>, when we should be living the present, in <em>what is</em>. Because truly, the past does 
            not exist anymore.
          </p>
          <p>That is the basis for one of my "new Values", a set of values which will be part of my constructed culture.
          </p>
          <p>I feel that this is one reason why I am so bad at conversing with people—I like sharing ideas and things I've been writing or 
            working on or thinking about, whereas most people simply want to talk about how their day has been or what crazy thing happened 
            to them yesterday or what have you; and I will simply have to listen to them even though I don't care whatsoever, because it 
            seems rude to say that I don't care. Perhaps I should just be upfront in saying that I like to talk about ideas rather than happenings.
          </p>
          <p>That of course isn't the only reason I'm bad at talking with people. The other reason is that I find it very hard to focus on 
            anything, especially something that I'm not interested in, and most conversations I won't be interested in. Somebody will ask 
            me something and I will take 20 seconds to respond, but the other person has already moved on. There is a sense of urgency and 
            immediately in today's culture, likely due to smartphones and social media. People don't like waiting for other people anymore.
          </p>
