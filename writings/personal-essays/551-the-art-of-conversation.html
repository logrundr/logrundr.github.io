          <p>Listening is very important—it's half of the art of conversation. I used to think I was a good listener. Maybe I was. I don't like talking, so I must like listening, right? No—I only like being in my own head.
          </p>
          <p>My mind is always wandering and thinking and paying no attention to anything in the real world, in the here and now. Somebody could be talking to me and I would just be in my own world, listening to exactly nothing that they have to say. The real problem is then if that person was to ask me a question. Suddenly I'm pulled out of the fantasy in my head, and I'm faced with reality. I'm like a deer in headlights. "I wasn't listening, so I have no immediate answer for you. Maybe I'll have no answer at all."
          </p>
          <p>I don't believe that I was always like this. I think that it's something that I developed during the quarantine. I was in heavy isolation, maybe only saying a few words every day, and very seldom was I faced with the task of listening to someone and formulating a thoughtful response. The most that I had to do was answer what I wanted for dinner. I grew accustomed to entertaining myself with my mind, so I got into the habit of daydreaming and wandering and wondering.
          </p>
          <p>The isolation of the quarantine also caused me to develop an anxiety of speaking—the other half of the art of conversation. I've dubbed my particular flavor of speech anxiety "deliberate mutism", although I must emphasise that that is not a legitimate or recognised medical condition. It's just a term that I use to describe how I feel.
          </p>
          <p>There are no situations where I am actually unable to speak. I can speak in all scenarios. However, there are many times where I choose not to speak, even when it might be best to say something. This is why I call it deliberate mutism, because I am deliberately not saying anything even though I could if I wanted to.
          </p>
          <p>I fear that people think that I'm stupid or simple. I'm just not good at conversation. I'm very articulate within my mind, and often the way that I think is in the style of a back-and-forth conversation between two parts of my mind; because of that, one might think that I would be a good conversationalist, and they would be wrong.
          </p>
          <p>All throughout my schooling years (up until the quarantine), I was considered one of the smartest in my class. I would help people with homework and make jokes; I would banter with friends and pass notes during class; I would do all sorts of things involving many methods of communication that are now incredibly difficult for me.
          </p>
          <p>And now I don't feel that I'm smart at all. I can't even communicate anymore. All I have is my mind, and an urgent need to understand what communication is so I can relearn how to participate in society.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>Communication is a vital part of our everyday lives. It is everywhere around us, and we can communicate without even thinking about it most of the time. Despite the incredible importance of communication, many people have slightly differing ideas of what it should be and how it should be carried out in our daily conversations. 
          </p>
          <p>Communication—for this essay, spoken communication only (that is, the specific <em>channel of communication</em> examined in this essay is largely verbal)—is the exchange of ideas. There are two main types of ideas that are conveyed during a conversation: the idea suggested by the semantics, and the idea suggested by the diction. The idea suggested by the semantics is the literal meaning of what is said, whereas the idea suggested by the diction is the way in which it is said. These are similar but distinct, because there are many different ways to say something that each give off a different energy. The semantics is usually unchanged from audience to audience, but the diction will wildly change depending on if your audience is a child or a close friend or a stranger.
          </p>
          <p>Here are two examples comparing the two types of exchanged ideas at play: “Space is big and empty, and we live in a very small part of it” vs. “All we are is just some species living on a rock in the middle of an expansive, lonely universe.” Notice that the semantics—the <em>meaning</em> of what is said—is largely the same in both examples, but the diction differs: in the first, the word choice is simple, and the “energy” of the phrase might conjure an adult explaining the Earth’s place in the universe; whereas in the second example, the diction is more sophisticated, and the “energy” suggests something more existential. The takeaway from this comparison is that the diction (and the energy the diction creates) can vary wildly even if the underlying semantics stays mostly the same.
          </p>
          <p>In a conversation, along with the two exchanged ideas, there are also two roles (or two halves to a whole conversation) that are played: the speaker and the listener. The speaker is the active role and the listener the passive one, which is not to suggest that one role is doing more than the other. The speaker has the task of choosing diction carefully so that the listener, their audience, can understand; the listener has the task of engaging with what the speaker’s saying and eventually voicing their thoughtful responses. The speaker can also be referred to as the sender, and the listener as the receiver.
          </p>
          <p>It may be that communication skews to one side, for example a boss explaining something to a new trainee, or even a billboard that you see on the side of the road, which communicates to you but which is impossible for you to communicate back. I call this type of communication “receptive”, because one side is largely or totally receiving information and not presenting any. Receptive communication is not usually a conversation. A conversation, where both sides are actively participating in the exchange of ideas, can be called active communication.
          </p>
          <p>Now, taking together everything that has been written so far, I will define the simple phrase, “The Art of Conversation”, which began this essay, as this: 
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%"><em>a type of active communication, in which both parties are actively participating in the exchange of ideas, and which contains two halves that each side takes turns sharing—that of speaking and listening.
          </em></p>
          <p>These postulates of communication are incredibly important and essential for day-to-day life, yet many people struggle with them, including myself. I struggle in all areas of spoken communication and social interaction, but I believe that defining the issue and identifying the areas where I have difficulty will help.
