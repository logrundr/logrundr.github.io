        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I'm becoming disillusioned with all that I have built my life up to be. Do any of my creations matter? Do I really want to 
            spend my whole life creating things? Did I ever actually want to do a degree in astrophysics? Did I ever want to add my computer 
            science minor? Why didn't I do something more artful or fun? Why didn't I spend more of my time on activities? Why have I 
            become so serious over the last few years? Where did all of my fun lightheartedness go? Why have I become numb to life's 
            experiences? Why can't I find anyone to love? Why doesn't anyone love me? Why have I wasted my time on nothings? Why don't 
            I have any friends? Why don't I have anyone? Why do I dress the way that I do? Do I want to dress in a different style? Do I 
            want to be somebody else? Do I want to live for someone else? Do I want to live for myself? Do I want to live? Do I want to die? 
            Does anything matter? Does love matter? Do I want to love someone? Am I ready to love someone? Is someone ready to love me? 
            What can I do to be more social? What can I do to be more lighthearted? What can I do to be more empathetic? What can I do to be 
            more charming? What can I do to be better?
          </p>
          <p>I feel like I want to throw everything away and start over anew. I want to leave my life and go somewhere else. I want to start 
            things over, from scratch, as a child, but I know that it can never be. I've done what I've done and it can't be undone. I must 
            live with the consequences of my actions.
          </p>
          <p>I want my life to be perfect. I feel like I'm stumbling around in darkness, reaching my hands out into the abyss, trying to find 
            something which isn't there but which I desperately need to exist. There isn't a light to illuminate everything around me, is 
            there? I will always be living in darkness—always stumbling around, searching for my way. I'll never find my perfection. I'll 
            never find my happiness. I'll never find my love. I'll never find anything—I'll only be stumbling. Where is my light?
          </p>
          <p>Why can't things ever go my way? With every decision I make, things don't turn out right. There is always something wrong. And 
            even if things turn out well, nothing lasts forever y'know: all good things must come to an end.
          </p>
          <p>And what is perfection anyway? My whole life I'll be cooking, cleaning, washing dishes, using the bathroom, eating, working, 
            sleeping, ...... that's not perfection. That's not living. How anyone can enjoy life I'll never understand. Do they have their 
            light while I'm left blind? Won't anyone take me by the hand and show me my way?
          </p>
          <p>Is everyone else disillusioned in the same way I am? Does anyone else know where they're going and why they're going that way? 
            Does anyone at all enjoy the life they're leading? There have been times where I've felt accomplished—where I've even felt like 
            I was on top of the world, like I was living the best day ever—but how could those times ever matter if they eventually end and 
            are replaced by sadness? Does everyone else experience such drastic mood swings, where one day they can be feeling great, yet as 
            soon as they experience some obstacle, even something incredibly tiny—barely an inconvenience—, they break down and can't seem to 
            handle anything anymore? Does anyone else feel so fragile? So easily breakable? Or is it just me?
          </p>
