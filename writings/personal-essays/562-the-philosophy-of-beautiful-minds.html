        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I've come up with a philosophy which helps to appreciate art. It was inspired by a phrase said by Thomas Wentworth Higginson to 
            Emily Dickinson, in which he thanked her for her "beautiful thoughts and words".
          </p>
          <p>I was affected by this quote, and remembered it; and not too long ago I realised that I had internalised it as my own, and 
            expanded the original phrase somewhat, into which I call the Philosophy of Beautiful Minds.
          </p>
          <p>This philosophy encourages that whenever one is engaging with a work of art, either visual, spatial, aural, or some other medium, 
            to look past the art and imagine its creator—but further than just imagining the creator, to imagine the creator's mind, and 
            specifically ask yourself, "what kind of mind must theirs be in order to create such beautiful art?"
          </p>
          <p>Another idea of mine has sprung from this philosophy, which refers to a work of art (especially music) and what I call an 
            "intriguer". I define it as this:
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%">
            <em><strong>Intriguer</strong>: a piece with a certain atmosphere (usually of playful mystery) and uniqueness, such that it 
              intrigues the listener to find other works by that composer. Usually intriguers tend to be the more famous of a composer's 
              works; i.e. Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody N. 2 or Un Sospiro (Concert Etude N. 3).
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>It is those most famous works—the <em>intriguers</em>—which inspire thought of the beautiful mind which must have created them. 
            And this mindset of looking at art in this way has made me more appreciative of the creators of them.</p>
