        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p><strong>James 2:14–17 </strong>(NRSV):</p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%"><em>14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you? 15 If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, 16 and one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and eat your fill,” and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is the good of that? 17 So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.
          </em></p>
          <p>These verses are the focus of this entry, and I will be using it in a secular rather than a religious manner. It can be described in a secular way as this: if what someone says or believes does not match their actions, then what they say or believe does not matter.
          </p>
          <p>I hear a lot of people say to me that they love animals; but does their faith match their works? In all cases that I have seen in person, they do not.
          </p>
          <p>Many peoples actions contradict with their beliefs. I am sure that I myself also have those contradictions. There are some contradictions that are so prevalent, however, that it is incredibly frustrating to people who recognise them. The one about loving animals as mentioned above is what I am mainly referring to. I recognise the hypocrisy and contradiction within that, so it's annoying when I find that their words, or faith, inevitably does not match their works.
          </p>
          <p>This can be extended to a lot of things within society. I think most people want to seem like they do good for society without actually doing anything, because doing something would be too much work. So they spread slogans on social media instead of making changes to their own way of living and trying to influence others into changing theirs. It's the modern day equivalent of a preacher who doesn't practice what he preaches.
          </p>
          <p>I find it strange how contradictions so large can exist in so many people. Is it that no one has self awareness of their own actions? Surely there must be some kind of internal struggle that fights between their beliefs and their actions. They attempt to justify the contradictions to such an extent as to distort the definitions of their beliefs and morals. I have seen it myself. And still they do not recognise themself as they are.</p>
