          <h3>The creative process</h3>
          <p>What is it that decides how creative I will be at a certain time? Is there some state of mind that can bring about a higher creativity? Is there a way to force myself to be creative? I suppose there are two ways to go about creating something: (1) extremely methodicalâ€”reading through books and papers and analysing past masters of the chosen craft; (2) create on instinct and your own intuition, relying on your own mind and your idea of what is beautiful instead of relying on the successes of past masters. 
          </p>
          <p>I have to say that (1) results in more well-crafted and thought-out works, which usually are more pleasing, but (2) results in a higher level of creativity that couldn't normally be found in (1). And besides, I think that within (1), there is a certain level of (2) that has to exist in order to create something.
          </p>
          <p>I prefer to work with (2), not just because I am lazy but also because it seems to work well for most things. 
          </p>

          <h3>Write drunk, edit sober (The effect of drugs on creativity)
          </h3>
          <p>How do drugs affect creativity? I've heard numerous times in the past that being drunk or high results in more creativity, which could also be why so many artists have drug problems. I just want to be more creative through whatever means. I'm sure that being under the influence of something would result more in (2), would it not? Being methodical is perhaps more effective for a complete work, but that is why the saying is "write drunk, edit sober": go crazy and be creative first, and then edit it thoughtfully later on. That plan should work out great. 
          </p>
          <p>I am always making plans, aren't I? I love to be organised and know what I need to do, but I almost never follow out my plans exactly. There is always something that goes wrong, either external or internal. But I have more plans, which I will now write:
