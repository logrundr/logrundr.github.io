          <p>I was very depressed for a long time—sometimes I think I've been for my whole life, and perhaps it's true. I still am. I play piano as a means to express myself. I play it as a form of meditation.
          </p>
          <p>A lot of my recent pieces are quiet, sad, nostalgic, bittersweet. In my pieces there's usually only a couple motifs that I just repeat again and again like a mantra. It really is meditation at the keyboard—I just repeat these mantras quietly, sort of like telling myself that it's going to be okay.
          </p>
          <p>Even the ones in a major key have a lot of minor chords or non-chord tones thrown in there to add dissonance and make the piece sound more bittersweet or longing than happy.
          </p>
          <p>My pieces are simple, repetitive, and hold a lot of emotional weight for me. They aren't really made for anyone except me. Listening to this repetitive, simple, emotion-driven music is also a form of meditation for me. Unlike a lot of artists, I can actually enjoy listening to my works and meditating with them going. The repetitive motifs are good for playing the piece on repeat.
          </p>
          <p>I'm not certain if my technique right now is suitable for playing a completely pure expression. If I get better, maybe my meditation will become more complex, and will reveal more of what I feel within my heart. What I am capable of playing right now satisfies me at the moment. If I would like to get better at some point in the future (or maybe I could slowly start improving now), then I have many books of studies that I haven't gone through at all.
          </p>

          <p>The left hand in my music is usually just playing the chords. Sometimes arpeggiated, but most commonly as blocks. The left hand is a steady rhythm, like the beating of a drum, or of my heart. That is repeated and serves as the base for me to play the melodies, or "mantras", as I will call them, with my right hand.
          </p>
          <p>There are usually two or three mantras within any of my pieces, each of them being different but very related and similar to each other. Sometimes the mantras will be in different keys, or completely atonal, but not often.
          </p>
          <p>The structure generally consists of going back and forth through two mantras, or repeating a pattern of the three mantras. There will commonly be a section towards the middle or end of the piece where the mantras are played in a different octave, usually higher.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>Occasionally my pieces will have more complex structures where I string together many mantras, although usually being in the same key, and they have short transitions between. 
          </p>
          <p>An example of this type is my project that I call <em><a href="../../projects/art/001-last-night-it-rained.html" title="a musical poem narration on animal rights">Last Night It Rained</a></em>. The music set the scene for multiple verses of poem, with each verse being distinct from the other, so the music had to reflect that; wherefore, the music followed the structure of the poem and was broken up into sections according to the verses, and connected by transitions or bridges. 
          </p>
          <p>That piece actually switches keys a couple times during its duration. I believe it starts in D major, but I might be wrong, since I think that I was thinking atonally when composing the introduction. It then goes into B-flat minor, with a short transition into D-flat major, its major equivalent. Then it goes back to D major for a quiet and somewhat wistful section. It finishes triumphantly on C major. 
          </p>
          <p>So, quite a musical journey in terms of keys. There aren't any fancy modulations where I go through a bunch of bridging chords. I just string them together, with no modulating chords. And I think the effect worked pretty well. I would say that that work, which I will call <em>Last Night It Rained</em>, since that is the title of the poem—although, I did not originally call the completed composition that—is perhaps my best composition, and certainly the one that I am most proud of.</p>
