          <p>I think I've successfully weaned videogames out of my diet. It's been several weeks now of playing nothing, and before that my 
            playing was quite sparse for several months. I really have no desire to play them at all any more. That's not to say that the 
            replacement has been any better: watching videos, or browsing social media. But, I'm also in the process of getting rid or 
            severely reducing those (down to just educational videos), and I will make use of my new free time by spending it on my hobbies, 
            like music, writing, drawing, designing (languages, systems, etc...), or poetry (a new hobby of mine which I've taken up in the 
            last month).
          </p>
          <p>I'd also like to spend some of that time in social settings, like a club. I joined a book club in January, but I've only gone 
            once, since I never was able to find the time to read the books. I'd like to try going back to that, or joining some other club. 
            There used to be a poetry club, but as far as I can tell it's now defunct.
          </p>
          <p>I want to change myself.
          </p>

          <p>Change is a motivator—motivation is a changer. Once there is a motivation to change one thing, suddenly you notice many 
            other areas that could also use changing, and things in your life that you're not entirely happy with.
          </p>
          <p>Cleaning up your life and making yourself better can be addicting, in a way. Has it ever happened that you're working on a 
            project, and things suddenly fall into place, or everything is going just as you planned? Is that not the most satisfying 
            feeling? So why then, shouldn't everyone be looking for that feeling within their self and their character, not just in their projects? 
          </p>
          <p>Of course they should be. Sometimes, though, chasing that satisfying feeling can first take a moment of bravery, which most 
            people aren't comfortable with. It means changing yourself; and changing yourself means admitting that there was something 
            worth changing in the first place; and admitting that means admitting that you have flaws.
          </p>
          <p>But, when you can admit those things, and can recognise areas of yourself that need changing, it's a motivator—not to mention, 
            in my opinion, one of the key things about being a mature person.
          </p>
          <p>A lot of people might think, that they are capable of changing other people. It's not possible—for someone to change, they 
            need to want to change themself. You can't force someone to change. Maybe you can eventually convince them, but what good 
            does it do you? You're wasting your time advising someone else when you could be advising yourself, and you're wasting time on an 
            idiot who will most likely never truly change themself. Just leave them be. Let them waste their own lives—stumbling through events, 
            chasing short-term pleasures, yet never considering the bigger picture of their circumstances. 
          </p>
          <p>Don't concern yourself with other people's behaviors. Just change yourself—to be a better, more virtuous, more generous, more 
            wise, and more creative person.
          </p>
