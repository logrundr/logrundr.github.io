          <p>When school was still going, there was one time during AP Lang where we were given several questions about society and we had to answer them as yes or no and explain. One of those questions was if "civilised" society is an illusion and we are actually just one step away from returning to barbarism. I was one of the only people that said yes to that question. Most people said that society is civilised and that people are good, but I knew that instincts always prevail over anything else. Sort of like <em>The Power of Context</em>, people will always think that they'll do something if in a certain situation, but that's their internal characteristics talking, and they don't matter when it comes to it.
          </p>
          <p>I think that the COVID-19 pandemic and the quarantine has shown quite nicely how quickly once "civilised" people can turn primal. And there are so many aspects of society that already aren't civilised in the slightest. For example, systemic animal abuse in the form of the animal product industries. And people <em>know</em> about the horrors of these industries but don't do anything against it and instead make flawed arguments to satisfy their cognitive dissonance and their hypocrisy. I would say that that's pretty barbaric—not just the animal torture itself, but the sort of willful ignorance from people participating in it.
          </p>
          <p>It's not just the industries that are barbaric... individuals are also one easy step away from turning into hateful, instinct-driven primates. This can be especially seen when people are angry, or in love—those two very different feelings make humans forget all morals and everything that they ever learned to be right and wrong. 
          </p>
          <p>I hate people sometimes because I fail to realise that within the bad there is also good. It's only because I've been surrounded by the bad, and the neutral, for my whole life. I think talking to one of my old friends has made me realise that there is still good in the world. I actually want to talk to her more. </p>
