          <h3>Self-Care</h3>
          <p>The most significant thing that I do for self-care is keeping a journal. Every day I write down my thoughts, and experiences, and everything else. It’s useful for me to get my thoughts written down, because then it’s easier to evaluate them and see what needs to be done. Also, it’s nice to see improvement over a period of time on something like mental health. I started my journal three years ago, when I was in a bad mental state and just needed somewhere to vent. I’ve improved a lot since then, but I enjoy writing so I keep doing it; and I like reading my old entries from a while ago to see what was going on back then.
          </p>
          <p>I also make music as a way of self-care and self expression. It helps release emotions. Learning other people’s works can also do that, but I find that learning other people’s works can make me feel inadequate at my instrument if I’m making a lot of mistakes. Making mistakes isn’t a problem if I’m just improvising, because during improvisation there is no such thing as mistakes. I don’t care much about becoming a virtuoso—I did at some point, but it made me not want to play anymore because I just wasn’t improving as fast as I would’ve liked. So I’ve given up on being the best, and I just play for myself and no one else.
          </p>

          <h3>What changes?</h3>
          <p>Many people already care about the well-being of animals. The problem comes when people are so conditioned that they are willing to put aside their feelings in order to save themselves from changing. People don’t want to change, because that would be to admit that they were wrong and have been doing wrong for many years—so instead, people come up with excuses to continue their behavior. I think this is characteristic of many forms of injustice where people might be participating in some way to oppression and injustice without acknowledging it, including animal rights.
          </p>
          <p>Another problem to recognise is that although people say they care about animals, what most people actually mean is that they care about pet animals—farmed animals are in some way inferior. 
          </p>
          <p>It is my belief that our treatment of animals contributes to many other forms of injustice. Since mistreating animals is so deeply rooted in our culture, it isn’t too far of a stretch to imagine that it can extend to other groups. If a group is dehumanised, like for example the Jews during the Holocaust, then it is easy to treat them poorly and view them as inferior, or “like animals”, since animals are also treated and viewed in those ways. A major step to take in animal justice is to recognise that all life has value, and no animal deserves to be exploited (in the same way that humans don’t deserve to be). There needs to be some major movement that pushes and applies these values, which the vegan movement as a whole is achieving.</p>
