        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I am very grateful for everything that my life has been. 
          </p>
          <p>My parents are good to me. People are good to me. I've generally been quite popular throughout my school years. 
            I've had relationships that stopped before things went too far and I regretted something, which I probably wasn't 
            happy about at the time but I am now.
          </p>
          <p>My life so far has been very quiet. And I'm thankful that I am who I am, because I like who I am and who I am 
            becoming. I've grown a lot over the duration of the quarantine (since March 2020), and will probably continue to 
            grow as I age. I like my development and everything that has happened to me so far in life. 
          </p>
          <p>I have no regrets. I have no difficult memories. I think it's hard to be grateful for thingsâ€”it's much easier to 
            complain about everything that's wrong.
          </p>
          <p>All circumstances are just a result of a large butterfly effect. There is no such thing as something that doesn't 
            happen as a result of something. In other words, there are no independent events. Every event is dependent on 
            something that happened before it.
          </p>
          <p>I'm grateful that my butterfly effect has so far been very positive. Life could be a lot better I think, but mine has 
            been better than most.
          </p>
