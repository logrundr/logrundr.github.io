        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I have always loved animals. I would pick up snails all the time when I was little, but I would be careful not to hurt them and I would always put them back in the grass when I was done. I never liked killing bugs or anything; my classmates used to do that in elementary school. They would crush bugs and I would beg them to stop, but I think they would do it anyway just to spite me. 
          </p>
          <p>In the 5th grade I learned where my food comes from. I learned that animals had to die for the meat that came to my plate. So I stopped eating meat. The day after I became vegetarian, I accidentally ate a chicken nugget when I was at school lunch with my friend Hiro. I remember he made fun of me for it and he would continue to bring it up every now and then throughout middle school.
          </p>
          <p>During the rest of 5th grade and into middle school, I learned that multiple types of cheese weren't vegetarian, so I cut those out of my diet. Pretty soon I decided that it would be easier just to cut out cheese altogether, and so I did. In October of 6th grade (2013), I made the decision to cut out dairy as well. This is when I made the shift into veganism. It wasn't actually so much of a shift, as it was a cold-turkey change—completely overnight. On a day after my 6th grade classes, I went up to my dad who was waiting outside the school and asked him immediately if I could be vegan and he said yes, if I was able to get all of my nutrients. Until 8th grade I would take vitamin supplements, but I stopped taking them when I got into high school. I didn't need them so much.
          </p>
          <p>The decision to cut out cheese and dairy was a good one, reinforced by my research into those industries and the discovery of the terrible things that those industries did and continue to do to this day. Most people would realistically abhor the practices of these industries, but the problem is that most people aren't aware that it goes on. This is why companies are pushing for ag-gag laws that make it basically impossible to document the horrible practices of their farms.
          </p>
          <p>My veganism is driven by a love for animals, and that's what veganism should really be about. If someone is "vegan" for the environment or for their health, then they are not vegan. Veganism is about reducing animal suffering to the absolute minimum. Environmental and health vegans don't do it to reduce animal suffering. Those people are merely on plant-based diets, and perhaps the environmental ones do a bit more like the rejection of leather/wool (as those can contribute to environmental damage, but I'm not sure how much).
          </p>
          <p>My ultimate goal is to find someone that is vegan for the same reasons as me, or to convert someone to veganism and make them truly care about it. I don't want to force someone into it just because they like me. I want them to know what it is about and care about the message. I would like to get involved with people more. I would like to go to protests and such. Getting involved with people is part of the reason why I want to organise family parties when I'm older.
          </p>
          <p>I've been vegan for over 6 years now. I hope to be for my whole life. If I am vegan for the animals then I don't see any reason why I could stop. I could never willingly hurt an animal—that is ultimately what people are doing when they eat meat. They are hurting animals. Killing them. And for what? For nothing.</p>
