        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>Sometimes I think about things, and how everything could be so much better than it is, but it can't ever be, actually.
          </p>
          <p>I am thinking of Perfection, of course. I want to live in Utopia. I want to be a beautiful person, and be surrounded by 
            beautiful people. And I don't want to be a member of society. I don't want to be a pawn in someone's game. I don't want to live 
            like everyone else, like an ant in a colony, because then I'll be worthless.
          </p>
          <p>I would rather be a spectator of the world. I would rather not be tethered to anywhere.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>I feel nostalgic, but for what I can't exactly say. I feel somehow out of place. I feel lost, like I don't know what to do—like 
            I've lost my way.
          </p>
          <p>There have been so many changes in my life recently. All of them were brought about by myself. I like the changes—they 
            improve who I am—but I can't help but feel that by changing myself, I also lose a part of myself. And, even if that part 
            was detrimental, it is still a loss. I think that is why I feel nostalgic. I'm longing for a time when I wasn't always 
            changing—that is, when I was static.
          </p>
          <p>It's nothing to wish for a time. I can spend all my life wishing on dimes, throwing them into fountains. It means nothing 
            more than anything else.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <p>I like the changes that I'm making to my life. I'll ignore the feelings I'm feeling, and think about what I want for my 
            future. I want, first and foremost, to be as creative as I possibly can be. I want to create as much as I can, and publish 
            things too. Today felt chaotic because I was doing all of these creative things and going back and forth all day on small 
            projects. I like the chaos. I don't like when I'm relaxing, not working on anything. It feels terrible for me to be wasting 
            my time—that's why I quit playing videogames: every time I would play, I would feel guilty that I wasn't spending that time 
            doing something better, and more creative. I feel that way no matter what pastime it is. In fact, I don't want to have any 
            pastimes, I want to only have hobbies.
          </p>
          <p>As a testament to my pursuit of hobbies and creative endeavors, I got a camera recently, and have been taking pictures, just 
            as I wished for in my last entry. This is what I want out of life. I want to always be continually branching out, exploring new 
            things. I don't understand how someone can dedicate their entire life to one topic—what if there was something out there which 
            they would like even more? How would they ever know if they never branched out? How can someone be content to spend their 
            entire life (of which they only live one) focusing on one thing out of the millions?
          </p>
          <p>I want to make sure that I can do as many things as possible, and make as much of an impact as such a small creature 
            as a human can muster to make.
          </p>
