          <p>I haven't written in these entries in two months. I feel as though I've almost forgotten entirely about them. In the 
            meantime I've been working on many other projects, and being busy with those kept my mind on things other than writing 
            in here. 
          </p>
          <p>I've also been coming up with a lot of little ideas that I can write about in here over the coming weeks to make up a 
            bit for my two month hiatus.

          <h3>On Being Deliberately Obtuse</h3>

          <p>I'm generally a very honest and direct person. I say exactly what's on my mind without putting my words behind a 
            facade of pleasantries. I don't understand the aversion to the word "no". In its place are always weak excuses at 
            an attempt to politely decline something, when I would argue that the most polite thing is kind honestyâ€”which means 
            saying no but not being rude about it.
          </p>
          <p>People need to slow down their conversations. They need to take their time thinking and speaking so they don't trip 
            over words or jumble things together or stutter. When people are asked a question, they feel obligated to answer almost 
            immediately, when what they really should do is spend a couple seconds thinking about the question they were asked before 
            answering.
          </p>
          <p>A common symptom of this is people saying "what?" after being asked a question, as if they didn't hear all of it or 
            didn't understand the question. But if the asker gives them a few more seconds, they will usually respond without the 
            asker having to repeat the question. They say "what?" as a reflex to get the asker to repeat the question so they 
            have more time to think about their response. It's totally unnecessary. People are afraid to think about things in silence.
          </p>
          <p>It confuses me that people would rather be polite than logical; it confuses me that many people feel that they have 
            to say something, even when they have nothing to say. My favorite thing about humans is what they are able to create, 
            and the meaning that they are able to derive from the Universe, but almost everything we do is completely meaningless. 
            I suppose it makes the meaningful moments even moreso.
          </p>
          <p>There is a problem within society today of building a facade of pleasantries, masking people from your pain, and 
            denying people of honesty. Truthfully, what some people might perceive as polite is only politeness in the short 
            term, and which is actually cruel in the long term. Sometimes people need to hear the hard truth and change 
            sometimes, and in the future they will be better for it. Don't allow people to suffer just because you don't 
            want to tell them that what they do is hurting them.
          </p>
