          <p>Last night I spent a couple hours creating different types of flexagons. It's difficult to describe how a flexagon works and what it is on paper, so it's best to watch a demonstration to understand them. I'll try to anyway. Basically, a flexagon is created from paper folded together in such a way that there are many overlapping sides, with only two sides (front and back) ever showing at a single time. To get to the other sides, you sort of have to fold the paper inside out, and then one of the inner sides will now be on the outside. You can perpetually keep folding and folding and going in circles.
          </p>
          <p>When you fold it inside out, what used to be the center now becomes the outer corners (or edges depending on the type of flexagon). On a hexa-hexaflexagon, there are three different types of centers that are possible, and I think every side (which I label a number) can have two possible centers, but I'm not sure about that yet.
          </p>
          <p>What is especially interesting about flexagons is to find out all of the different combinations of sides that are possible. For example, side 1 and side 2 can be opposite each other; can side 5 and side 6 be opposite each other, or are some combinations impossible? And also, <em>how</em> do you get to those combinations from a starting point? As in, what moves must be done? How to get to any possible combination from a starting point is called the Tuckerman Traverse.
          </p>
          <p>I created a hexa-hexaflexagon, a tetra-hexaflexagon, and a hexa-tetraflexagon. They were a cool discovery for me, and when I found out about a bunch of different types, I wanted to try to make a few. The hexa-hexaflexagon is the best one out of the three, because it has the most combinations of sides. 
          </p>
          <p>They are basically my new fidget toys. I think I will play around with them a bit more, and make new ones etc. Maybe I could even come up with my own flexagons! That might take some work though...</p>
