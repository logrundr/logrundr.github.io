        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>There is an ego to living. When you go outside, who's to say that you deserve to be there? Who's to say that other people 
            will benefit from you being outside, and interacting with them? It is your ego which says that you deserve to be there. It 
            is your ego which says that you can benefit other people.
          </p>
          <p>Everybody naturally thinks of themself as higher than everyone else. How can you not? Your experiences and your life are the 
            only ones that you can ever fully know, so how can you not view yourself above others?
          </p>
          <p>Everybody thinks that their actions are good. No one commits actions because they judge them to be detrimental. There is always 
            a reason that someone has for committing a certain action. Those reasons are called impressions. Every action is the result of 
            impressions. Do you get an impression that this certain action will be beneficial? Then do the action. That is how things work. 
            And it is our ego which drives this—we believe in ourselves to make good decisions, and we believe that our own judgment of 
            what is good and bad is the most correct one, because it is the one that we ourselves deduced.
          </p>
          <p>So there is this inherent ego to living; and everything that we do is dictated by this ego, which itself impacts our impressions 
            of things around us.
          </p>
          <p>And we know that we are ourself. We can trust in our senses and our experience of the world to say that we are ourself, and we 
            are separate from the things around us. And we are separate in some way from any other person. If you feel hungry, that doesn't 
            mean that I also feel hungry. If I cut you, that does not mean that I've cut myself too—not in a physical way, but in the way 
            that we are all connected to the Universe, and so we are all driven by the same mechanisms which drive the Universe, it can be 
            said that by damaging you, I am also damaging myself. As I say within my "Universal Religion" (Universal Philosophy):
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%"><em>
            <em>"Be kind to the creatures of the Earth. And be kind to the Earth and the Universe and everything that you can see, for it 
              all belongs to the Universe and it is all a part of the same. To abuse any creature would be to abuse the Universe. Care for 
              the Earth and the creatures within it, for if they suffer then you are suffering too."
            </em></p>
          <p>Why should it be that we consider ourselves above others? If you see yourself as an equal, then everything becomes much 
            easier. That's how I should look to view things.
          </p>
