          <p>The conscious mind doesn't know itself. Only the subconscious mind does. That is why it is impossible to ever evaluate your own character, and easier to evaluate others. Think, for example, to when you're conversing with another. Do you think about everything that you say, or is most of it too fast for your conscious brain to think about? That is why they say that the things that slip out when you actually mean something different is how you actually feel, since it is the subconscious speaking, and not through the filter of the conscious mind. Such a thing is called a Freudian slip.
          </p>
          <p>Now, is it ever possible to access the subconscious? Spirituals might tell you yes. I say that the only time it is possible is while sleeping. Dreams are a glimpse of how the subconscious works, and what it thinks. 
          </p>
          <p>Anyway, my point is that other people know your character better than you do.

          <p>That is all of that.
          </p>
          <p>I want to do so much over the next week, but I don't have enough time for it all. I have quite a few assignments that I need to complete before the deadline next Friday. I hope I'm able to complete it all. I think I'll be able to manage, but I've been so tired lately and my mind feels foggy. It makes it very difficult to think, and to focus on tasks and get them done in a reasonable amount of time. I remember this last Sunday I was trying to write an assignment for my Social Change class, and I actually couldn't think of a single word to write down for a prompt. I couldn't think of anything, so I just turned in what I already had, which was probably a sufficient amount, but it was somewhat worrying to me that I was just unable to think.
          </p>
          <p>I'm actually having that problem while writing this entry. I don't know what to write about. It's been like that for a while actually. I know I keep coming up with more excuses for my lack of writing, but this mind fog might actually be a good explanation for it. If I can't come up with anything to write about, then why would I write at all? I don't know how I did it a year ago, when I was writing multiple entries a day. Not only do I wonder how I came up with so many topics (although, let's be honest, it is probably mostly just about my crush at the time and now ex-girlfriend), I also wonder how I had the time to write them. Writing an entry nowadays takes me 30 minutes at least. I wonder if it was the same back then, or if I was speeding through them and not taking my time. I had the mindset, in that time, of quantity over quality. I wanted badly to write as many entries as I could, and perhaps have like 100,000 entries by the time I die (which would be about 4 entries a day). It <em>would</em> be very impressive to have 100,000 entries by my death, but that will almost definitely not happen. A more reasonable answer is about 20,000 or so, which is still a lot. 
          </p>
          <p>I try to write at least one entry a day (I would like to write two, but I can never find the time or the motivation), but it is very hard to come up with ideas to write about. I feel like I've exhausted all possibilities, even though I know that that is certainly not the case.
