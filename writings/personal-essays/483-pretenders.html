          <p>Being in lockdown has its upsides, but mostly I just want to talk to people; I want to have friends again; I 
            want the world to not just go back to normal, but to be <em>better</em>. Too many people are <em>pretenders</em>—people 
            always have been, for all of time. They do things that make them appear like better people than they really are, to 
            others and to themselves. These kind of people don't improve society—they pretend that they do, which might be even 
            more dangerous than not doing anything at all. It's especially frightening how convincing some of these pretenders 
            are. I've spotted many of them (I am not saying that I am not a pretender myself. It is as I have written about 
            before: people are bad judges of themselves)—a lot of people are fooled by them; but then again, it might only 
            be the other pretenders who are fooled. 
          </p>
          <p>The society that I want will never come to life. It never will in my lifetime. Humans have always been greedy, 
            self-centered creatures, and they always will. There is nothing that can be done to change our nature. The few 
            of us who are good are outnumbered and overwhelmed by the many that are bad. 
          </p>

          <p>I think I'm generally thought of as smart but a bit simple. That might even be an accurate description of me. 
            I don't mind it—maybe I even like that description. There have been many moments, especially more recently, 
            where I have considered the possibility that I have ADHD or even autism. ADHD is probably quite likely since 
            {my brother} also has it. I think it would explain some of my behaviors, but that doesn't mean that it would 
            be an excuse. A lot of people use their disability or disorder as an excuse for their own personal failings, 
            when what they should really be focusing on is being a better person. Deep down I know that they are only 
            pretenders, and that there is nothing more that can be done for them other than for them to help themselves—you 
            can't help pretenders.
          </p>
          <p>Ever since I was very young, people have regarded me as smart. I don't know whether they thought of me as 
            boring—in 5th grade they probably wouldn't have. I was just like everyone else in 5th grade, except I found 
            the work trivial where some people struggled. In middle school I developed more of a personality, as did 
            everyone else. This is perhaps where people would think of me as more of a nerd, or a dork if that term was 
            still in use. I was still thought to be one of the smartest in the school, and people were always asking 
            me for answers on stuff—at that point in my life, I probably wouldn't hesitate to give them the answer. 
            A friend even signed my book in 6th grade as: "We have to have classes next year for the answers. But 
            don't have a great summer. Just read your text books! -(your best fren)".
          </p>
          <p>Was she a pretender? I follow a lot of people from those days on Instagram, and it seems that many that were 
            pretenders, still are. It's probably not something you can grow out of. I don't see how people can go their whole 
            lives without creating anything, or doing anything for the betterment of humanity, or even for the betterment 
            of themselves. 
          </p>
          <p>To live, and to learn, and to create, and to learn more to create more. That is my motto and it's what I live 
            by. There is scarcely a moment where I'm not thinking about some project that I have planned, and what some 
            aspect of it should be like. What do other people spend all of their time doing? Scrolling on social media? 
            Watching videos? It's a waste of life. Life is this precious thing that we have all been given and have only 
            one chance to live, and yet many people are wasting their time on meaningless things that do nothing for them 
            and nothing for anything. I admit that there are times when I am wasting my life. I think everyone has those times. 
          </p>
          <p>But for those times to be <em>all the time</em>? Surely you must get bored with yourself...</p>
