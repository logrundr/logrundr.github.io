        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>I am of the opinion that anyone can learn anything, because anything that humans make must necessarily be able to be understood by humans. Understanding is different from knowledge—there is always something new to learn even in simple things, because simplicity brings about complexity.
          </p>
          <p>For example, chess is a game with simple rules, but it is not a simple game to play.
          </p>
          <p>I believe that anything can be understood if enough time is dedicated to it. The problem is that many people don't have the drive or the will to be able to focus on learning something. The fault of humans is in their drive, not their intellect.
          </p>
          <p>Humans are capable of creating. The same cannot be said of many animals on this planet. However, I think that animals are a lot closer to humans than most people want to admit—after all, most people eat animals, and it would be painful to admit that they feel and think similarly to humans.
          </p>
          <p>Humans are unique though. We have conquered the planet due to our ability to use our hands to create and our minds to invent.
          </p>
          <p>I think that nothing that humans create is complex. There is nothing so complex that humans have created that it cannot be understood by other humans.
          </p>
          <p>In the past I would have thought that there are some things in the world that are too complex for understanding, especially by people less intellectually endowed. Now I am not so sure. I used to look down on the people that thought that anyone can do anything—I thought it was just overly optimistic malarkey. I believe it now.
          </p>
