          <p>I have come up with a term to describe my kind of speaking "style". I call it deliberate mutism, as the title for this entry suggests.
          </p>
          <p>Deliberate mutism is distinguished from selective mutism, an actual psychological term. Selective mutism is a mental condition where you are unable to speak in certain situations. It has severe anxiety associated with it.
          </p>
          <p>I don't have selective mutism. There are no situations where I am actually unable to speak. I can speak in all scenarios. And I don't have any severe anxiety associated with speaking in certain situations. However, there are many times where I choose not to speak, even when it might be best to say something. This is why I call it deliberate mutism, because I am deliberately not saying anything even though I could if I wanted to. 
          </p>
          <p>I like to think of myself as someone who chooses their words carefully; someone who is quiet and doesn't speak much, but when they do they say exactly the right words; someone who is perhaps too quiet in some situations; someone who sometimes doesn't say anything at all; someone who prefers to observe people rather than engage with them.
          </p>
          <p>I'm not sure why I'm like this. It's a condition that developed in the past couple of years. It's possible that people's expectation of me as the "quiet kid" influenced me into actually being very quiet. This kind of influence is something called "labeling theory", where a label continuously put on someone influences their identity. 
          </p>
          <p>So, is that why I'm like this? People certainly do know me as the quiet kid, but they don't call me that often enough to warrant a complete change in my identityâ€”no, this is self-inflicted I think. 
          </p>
          <p>It might be that during the summer of 10th to 11th grade, I was exceptionally quiet. I do remember not speaking very much at all. I tended to stay in my room for the entire day, as I do now, only coming out to eat. My sleep schedule was probably also very messed up, so I would've been awake when everyone else was asleep. It's possible that I developed a habit of not speaking, since I never saw anyone while I was awake, and that habit developed into a more permanent condition of mild mutism. Of course, that's not to say that the condition is actually permanent. I believe that I can grow out of it.
          </p>
          <p>I thought this was an important and interesting enough aspect of myself to write it within these entries.</p>
