        <!-- Main Content -->
        <div align="justify" style="margin: 0 10% 10px 10%">
          <p>Almost everyone seems fake. It seems that they just go through life, without ever actually living, or thinking about their life, 
            or doing anything. Is that wrong of me to think?
          </p>
          <p>It seems to me, that people waste their time chasing fleeting pleasures rather than pursuing long-term happiness. And more 
            than that, people care too much of what other people think of them, and not enough about what is within their control. Is it 
            in your control to treat others kindly always, and to treat everything with the same respect you afford yourself (which, if 
            you don't respect yourself, will be none; but any sane person's goal should be to respect themself), and to not care about 
            what others think of yourself?
          </p>
          <p>No one should worry about what others think. If you do so, you are concerning yourself with an idiot's opinion. Is that valuable 
            to you? Of course it isn't. Those opinions that you care so much about and hold in such high esteem, are the opinions of fake 
            people—people who make no effort in improving themselves, but are quick to give judgment upon others and give advice which they 
            don't follow themselves.
          </p>
          <p>Is the way that other people see you within your control? Only insofar as the way you act. But you should never mold the way you 
            act to please others around you. Why do you get nervous when speaking infront of others? Not because of anything within your 
            control. It is within your control to give a good speech, not whether the audience will receive it well—so you shouldn't worry 
            about what the audience will think. In this way you won't be nervous.
          </p>
          <p>Be unabashedly yourself, with full confidence, because you have control over your Self. Molding yourself into what you think other 
            people want of you will only cause you agony, and it will cause you to value things that can hurt you. If you value the opinion of 
            others, won't you be hurt if others don't like you? If you value your wife, won't you be sad when she dies? If you value your 
            belongings, won't you be angry if they're stolen? If you recognise that everything is temporary, and that the impermanence of 
            these things are outside your control, then you won't be hurt. 
          </p>
          <p>You can only lose what you have, so instead be appreciative that you had it at all, and that it made an impact on your character 
            in some way. If you lose your wife, that is because you had a wife. If your belongings are stolen, that is because you had 
            belongings. Be thankful in that way.
          </p>
          <p>Why do people waste their time on nothings? Always be looking to improve yourself, and to find long-lasting happiness. Do this 
            by looking into your soul, recognising the good in it, and plucking the evil from it; and using the faculty of reason to find 
            inner peace from the goodness within your soul.
          </p>
