          <p>Sometimes it is necessary to be bored because, as they say, boredom breeds creativity. The problem with modern machines is that they remove boredom from the system. In doing so, they also kill creativity. When there is no need to be creative and make our own fun, and when entertainment is so easily available, there becomes no need for creative expression. Because creative expression is driven through boredom and the subsequent need to create it, to create anything, to alleviate our boredom.
          </p>
          <p>And so modern machines are a curse. To many, they help with communication or the displayal of our ideas, but really they are nothing more than a hinderance. Society was much better off before the days of technology. I have seen it myself—the way that skills have declined over the years, and the way that laziness has risen. 
          </p>
          <p>It has happened to me. When I was young I was creative. When I had no machines to surround me and fill the void created by boredom, I had my mind—my mind is enough to fill any gap, and it is this way for anyone. Modern machines make us think that that isn't the case. When I was young, I had my pen and paper. And what I drew can be seen as art. Take the earliest example that I have—"The Monster", written when I was 6—and look at the creativity in that. No doubt if I had technology available to me, I would not have found the need to create anything. I would have filled my boredom through constant stimulation of the senses. 
          </p>
          <p>This way of filling boredom is in itself boring, but that doesn't mean that we don't enjoy it as humans. Humans like constant stimulation and easy rewards. That's not necessarily given when filling boredom through creative means like drawing or music; in fact, it's not at all given. The arts are difficult skills to master, but browsing the web and watching videos, listening to other people's music... that's not difficult at all. It's mind-numbing. Maybe that's what some people need, but it's not what anyone wants. </p>
