          <h3>What is Music? Why does it affect us so deeply?</h3>

          <p>
            Music is, at its core, entirely rhythm. To the Universe, there exists no concept of pitch, only rhythm. And every 
            <m title="pitch difference between two notes" id="dotted">interval</m> is merely a polyrhythm—that is, two rhythms 
            played simultaneously. Every interval in music has a ratio between the frequencies of the pitches played. Frequency
            is the amount of times per second that waves are sent through air, called Hertz or Hz. A ratio of 2:3 means that 
            for every 2 waves sent by the first frequency, 3 are sent by the second. This can be thought of as a 2:3 
            polyrhythm. When played sufficiently fast, it sounds a perfect 5th (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3hdTbtLra4" 
            id="external">1</a> for a demonstration). In this way, music is entirely rhythm.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ratios between intervals is what ultimately affects us and gives music its emotion. The octave, a ratio of 
            2:1, is the simplest interval in music (besides the unison of 1:1), and therefore doesn't affect us very much. On
            the other hand, there are ratios which are too complex to be emotional, like a ratio of 1957:1743. The key is finding
            ratios in between which aren't too simple, neither are they too complex.
          </p>
          <p>There is also of course the many other aspects of music besides pure pitch. There is tempo, rhythm, dynamics,
            and articulations. Music is incredibly complex, and each of these aspects brings further emotion out of the player and 
            into their instrument (including the voice).
          </p>

          <h3>What is Classical Music?</h3>

          <p>
            The term <em>classical music</em> is actually quite broad; however, it generally refers to the longstanding
            formal tradition of music, especially in the Western world. It also typically has complex musical forms,
            harmonic structures, polyphony, and is almost always written
            down (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music" id="external">2</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The formality and complexity of classical music is what separates it from the folk tradition.
            This article will only be focusing on the Western tradition of classical music, although some aspects 
            can be applied to other traditions as well.
          </p>

          <h3>Music in the Era of Recording</h3>

          <p>
            The advent of the phonograph changed the music scene forever. Suddenly you didn't have to write music to get your 
            music known, you simply had to be able to play and record it. This allowed many folk and amateur musicians 
            to record their work and spread it around. The classical composer Bela Bartók sought to preserve Hungarian folk songs 
            by recording folk singers on an Edison phonograph 
            (<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14416746" id="external">3</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly all types of music were equally accessible, and an orchestra and opera singers would be just as loud as 
            a folk musician with a guitar. As it turns out, the guitar was the primary instrument of blues and folk musicians in the 
            early 20th century, and the steady chugging rhythms of the Delta Blues style was incredibly influential upon
            rock musicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way in which music was viewed changed. Before the phonograph, music was a rare thing typically played only in social
            settings like Salons or at music concerts like Operas or Recitals. After the phonograph, music could be played at any 
            time and for any reason, including outside of social settings. People began to play music in the background while 
            doing other things. This is a very common usage of today's popular music. Many people put on music to play in the 
            background while studying, doing homework, washing the dishes, or driving their car. Music has become simply noise 
            to stimulate our ears while we do mundane tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Classical music requires intent listening—it needs attention in order for the listener to grasp all of the thematic 
            changes and development. Modern music is generally quite repetitive and therefore works better as a piece of 
            background music due to a lack of development. An extreme example of repetitiveness and "backgroundness" is what 
            is today called "elevator music" or "muzak", but at the time of its conception was called "furniture music".
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>The Advent of "Furniture Music"</h3>

          <p>
            The classical composer Erik Satie envisioned a kind of music never before created. In his time, music was 
            art, and art demanded that attention be paid to it. He created the idea of background music, which he called 
            "furniture music". In 1917 Satie commented this to a friend:
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%">
            <em>Furniture music is something that should be created—that is, music would be part of the ambience,
              which would take account of it. I imagine it being melodic in nature: it would soften the noise of knives
              and forks without dominating them, without imposing itself. It would furnish those silences which 
              sometimes hang heavy between diners. It would save them from everyday banalities. At the same time,
              it would neutralise those street sounds which impinge on us indiscreetly.
            </em>
            (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=3_KjCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq=erik+satie+furniture+music+is+something+that+should+be+created&source=bl&ots=awxEeyIGk2&sig=ACfU3U0pofT0NM1-mCeoqFW60LZVWpIKXA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjO5OWEi7H5AhWGLEQIHYuvAbIQ6AF6BAg_EAM#v=onepage&q=erik%20satie%20furniture%20music%20is%20something%20that%20should%20be%20created&f=false" 
            id="external">4</a>)
          </p>
          <p>
            Furniture music was a crucial step in removing the art from music and turning it just into a piece of furniture—something
            to be ignored and blend into the environment in the same way that a chair or a rug does. Furniture music was made 
            to be boring and repetitive because no one was meant to pay attention to it (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeYVCd84zek&t=4s" 
            id="external">5</a>, and see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX9xb_veUJ3qxPWs8cExBx7wEKx-6mhHF"
              id="external">6</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of music meant to blend into the background was expanded when jazz became popular. Jazz in its 
            most popular form was subtle, smooth, mellow, and quietly melodic; in other words, it was the perfect sound 
            for blending into the background. Of course, many other genres of modern music are played in the background,
            but jazz perhaps works the best out of all of them, especially since many jazz tunes are only instrumental,
            allowing people to work on whatever they're doing without being distracted by lyrics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem is that the creation of background music destroyed not only its own art, but also the art of 
            all other music. Because background music, and other genres which could act as background music (which is 
            essentially all of modern music), had become so popular, perception of music in general had shifted into a 
            more casual mindset, classical music included. Modern performers of classical music began, subconsciously or 
            not, to incorporate the values of modern music into classical, attempting to destroy the art in classical 
            and replace it with the ability to be played in the background.
          </p>

          <h3>On the Tasteful Playing of Classical Music</h3>

          <p>
            There is a general opinion that I have seen which states that the great pianists of the 19th and early 
            20th century played music, especially the piano, tastelessly and with too much rubato or embellishments. 
            Whereas, I believe that more modern classical music recordings are allowing the ideas of modern genres like 
            rock or pop to permeate into the interpretations of the much older classical music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Modern genres, particularly rock, are based on groove—the music is primarily meant to be something that you 
            can stamp your feet, bob your head, or tap your fingers to. Because of this, rubato in modern genres is either 
            nonexistent (due to being recorded to a click track) or very subtle. This idea of eliminating rubato has managed 
            to make its way into classical recordings despite most classical music not relying on a groove like modern music 
            does. Because of this recent approach, opinions towards older classical performances and descriptions of how 
            classical music used to be performed have been more negative in recent years.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pianists of the 19th and early 20th century were in fact much more expressive in their use of rubato, 
            but also in all aspects of their playing. Improvisation within classical performances is extremely rare and 
            even discouraged, because modern society does not value personal emotional expression as strongly as it once did.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are living today through an age of professionalism, which stifles creative expression and instead 
            prioritises the exact recreation of the sheet music.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Modern Professionalism</h3>

          <p>
            Society's aesthetic decisions have led to professionalism: long gone are the days of
            elaborate and intricate woodwork as found in Baroque and Romantic architecture and furniture, as well as the 
            incredibly busy interior decoration of the Victorian Era (see 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rococo" id="external">7</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_decorative_arts" id="external">8</a>). 
            The 1960s saw a boom in modernism and minimalism,
            in areas from architecture to furniture to graphic design, and yes, to music.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Romantics of the 1800s emphasised emotion, the expression of the individual, idealisation of nature,
            and suspicion of science and industrialisation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism" id="external">9</a>). 
            By the 1950s, a counterculture
            had emerged in youth from rock'n'roll, and by the 1960s, that counterculture grew immensely and became mainstream
            and political, focusing on love, sexuality, and, perhaps most famously, anti-war and anti-government sentiments. 
            In many ways
            the so-called counterculture of the 1960s followed the tenets of Romanticism: hippies are well known for expression 
            of emotion and the self, especially sexually; of their idealisation of nature and the natural self; and their 
            inclination to reject science for more "herbal" approaches. This "counterculture" was actually an extreme
            embodiment of Romanticism, creating psychedelic rock in the tradition of <em>popular music</em>,
            and the <em>real</em> counterculture was the culture promoting 
            minimalism, brutalism, modernism, and ugly, hard to relate to works.
            This was a direct counter to the at times overwhelming and overbearing intricacy, complexity, and beauty of
            the Victorian, Edwardian, and Art Deco Eras that the earlier generations had lived through.
          </p>
          <p>
            This culture of ugliness didn't crop up out of nowhere. It was born from a generation who had grown up in the 
            midst or wake of the 
            Great Depression, and who had lived through World War II. It's no wonder that ugliness and minimalism were 
            their primary modes of expression. 
            In terms of music, the dispensing of many notes and focus on simplicity
            is what living in the Great Depression was forced to be, with limited money, limited food, and a need to 
            focus on the small things to remain sane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The government was ultimately partly responsible in allowing the Depression to get as severe as it did, but they were 
            also responsible for getting the country out of it—people looked to the country for assistance desperately. Even long 
            after the Depression had ended, and quality of life was actually at an all-time high, people remained stuck in their 
            ways, perhaps of frugality, most importantly of reliance on authority.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reliance on authority extends to academic spheres. And in academic spheres, it is largely unacceptable to 
            show emotion in professional works. The burgeoning counterculture of minimalists, brutalists, and "modern art"
            infiltrated academic spheres—these same people were the ones being criticised by academics decades earlier
            within the 1920s and '30s as "degenerates".
            The formal art of classical music, once treated in the past as an extension of 
            values regarding self expression and emotion, was now transformed into a sterilised academic form of study and 
            research. Classical music was allowed to become this because it was old: the new tradition of pop music 
            had surpassed it in popularity years before. Sheet music was no longer considered a means for 
            creating emotional art; instead 
            it showed the performer exact instructions, like a scientist's procedure for an experiment, or, perhaps, like 
            a computer following an algorithm.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h3>Analog by Computer</h3>

          <p>
            A digital computer operates on 1s and 0s. An analog computer is one which uses an <em>analog</em> to simulate and 
            solve a real world problem. The earliest example of a complex analog computer is the Antikythera mechanism 
            (Μηχανισμός Αντικυθήρων), discovered in 1901 in a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera.
            The machine dates to around 150 BCE, and contains over 30 gears used for predicting astronomical positions and 
            eclipses (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism" id="external">10</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            Analog computers such as the Antikythera mechanism aren't exact: the turning of the gears is what tells you
            the answer, not some computation of 1s and 0s, and because of that, reproducing the same answer twice is impossible—the 
            mechanism has an infinite range of possible inputs. Digital computers by comparison are much more robust, but some 
            amount of variability and intuitiveness is lost there. Digital computers are logical and versatile, but the simple 
            attractiveness of a set of gears capable of predicting complex astronomical problems is compelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's the same way in music. There is no space in music for a binary—a simple on or off. Music must have a range of 
            dynamics, articulations, and tempo. And a performance which has such a range is not just compelling and attractive,
            but also capable of conveying extremely rich emotions.
            A binary performance is one without soul, the same as a computer does not have 
            sentience. AI uses algorithms to get what it's after, and the results are completely without awareness. An AI 
            generating an image of a flower field doesn't really know what a flower is, or the sky, or any of the individual 
            components of such an image that a human might be interested in. It simply compiles images of flower fields and 
            generates a new one based on those.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans are more original than AI, though. Humans don't just copy what others do, they are capable of originality, and 
            of looking at the little things to paint a more accurate and compelling big picture. A person who has understanding of 
            what a flower looks like, or what a blade of grass is, will be able to paint a more realistic scene of a flower field. 
            Similarly, someone who is able to take a piece of music and interpret it, pull it apart, dissect its emotions, and also 
            have the willingness to play with such a range too, will play better than one who only pays attention to what the 
            sheet music says and who follows it exactly to the letter. As the great Franz Liszt puts it:
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0 5% 0 5%">
            <em>Music embodies feeling without forcing it to contend and combine with 
            thought, as it is forced in most arts and especially in the art of words. ... Music presents at once the intensity 
            and the expression of feeling.</em>
            (<a href="https://wwnorton.com/college/music/concise-history-western-music4/ch/20/composerbio.aspx" id="external">11</a>)
          </p>
          <p>
            Music is meant to be spontaneous, never reproducible, and always played according to how the player feels while
            they are playing, and not according to how they prepared themselves to feel. In the sense of music's
            irreproducibility, it is a bit like an analog computer, which, because of the infinite range of possible inputs,
            it is impossible to precisely match the same input twice and therefore impossible to receive precisely the
            same output. Thus is the way of the human mind.
