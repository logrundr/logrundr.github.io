          <h3>The Social Idea of Justice</h3>

          <p>
            Justice is society's way of making somebody pay for their crimes. Justice means retribution. It's the idea that someone deserves
            what they give to others. But what does that do for anyone? If a serial murderer is caught, should they be tortured as a way for them
            to pay for their crimes? What good does that do anyone? Should they be put to death?

          <h3>The Problem of a Biased Eye-for-an-eye View</h3>

          <p>
            The central problem with justice is that it is entirely subjective. Revenge and an-eye-for-an-eye are even more 
            problematic, since they allow everyone to be a vigilante, punishing "crimes" however they see fit.
            Take, as an example, the view of a [specific type of] school shooter. Let's say they are heavily bullied and outcast
            from the cliches at school. It is likely that they will imagine ways of getting revenge on their bullies. In the most
            benign circumstance, it might just be telling teachers about it to get them to stop it. But in most cases the student
            has already done that and it hasn't worked, or maybe it has even worsened it. So they imagine ways that they themselves
            can stop it. That is how a school shooter happens. By allowing the outdated eye-for-an-eye view to pervade our
            courts and legal systems, it also invades all of our minds and allows us to think that revenge is fair and natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            The school shooter example is why revenge is not a good concept. When faced with continual abuse, people will think of
            wild, completely immoral actions in order to stop it. Revenge allows the victim to act out their anger on their abusers,
            often in ways that when viewed from an outside perspective seem extreme.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <p>
            In this view of an eye-for-an-eye, self-defense can be seen as a form of justice, since it is a form of vigilantism, which
            itself is a form of revenge. If someone breaks into your home, your defense of yourself and your home is a direct
            response to their break-inâ€”it is an act of revenge for their intrusion into your home, as well as an act of 
            self-preservation to ensure the safety of your own life.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where justice is acceptable. Justice is acceptable if it prevents a direct and immediate danger to your life, as is the 
            case in the home intrusion example. On the other hand, shooting up a school because you have been bullied in the past is obviously not 
            an acceptable form of justice, because the bullying was in the past and there is no immediate danger to your life. The bullying is an 
            explanation, but it is no excuse. However, many schools don't view self-defense as a valid application of justice. Many schools 
            have a policy called the no-tolerance policy, which says that a victim is not allowed to fight back and should seek an authority
            to enact punishment on the bully. This is a failure by the schools.

          <h3>Justice is Outdated</h3>

          <p>
            We have now established that Justice is acceptable if it prevents a direct and immediate danger to one's life. I believe that this 
            is this the one and only case where justice is acceptable. In all other cases, justice is an outdated notion and rehabilitation 
            should be tried instead. The reason that I think this is because justice doesn't help anything, especially the perpetrator. It locks
            them away; out of sight, out of mind.
