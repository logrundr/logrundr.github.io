          <h3>The Social Idea of Justice</h3>

          <p>
            Justice is society's way of making somebody pay for their crimes.

          <h3>The Problem of a Biased Eye-for-an-eye View</h3>

          <p>
            The central problem with justice is that it is entirely subjective. Revenge and an-eye-for-an-eye are even more 
            problematic, since they allow everyone to be a vigilante, punishing "crimes" however they see fit.
            Take, as an example, the view of a [specific type of] school shooter. Let's say they are heavily bullied and outcast
            from the cliches at school. It is likely that they will imagine ways of getting revenge on their bullies. In the most
            benign circumstance, it might just be telling teachers about it to get them to stop it. But in most cases the student
            has already done that and it hasn't worked, or maybe it has even worsened it. So they imagine ways that they themselves
            can stop it. That is how a school shooter happens. By allowing the outdated eye-for-an-eye view to pervade our
            courts and legal systems, it also invades all of our minds and allows us to think that revenge is fair and natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            The school shooter example is why revenge is not a good concept. When faced with continual abuse, people will think of
            wild, completely immoral actions in order to stop it. Revenge allows the victim to act out their anger on their abusers,
            often in  ways that when viewed from an outside perspective seem extreme.
