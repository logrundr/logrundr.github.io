        <p>Sections three and four make the argument that all animals are equal, and that our only reason for eating certain animals and keeping others as pets is tradition. With the lines, “People don’t often realise the harm / that their choices can have / especially if they aren’t there / to see the victims”, there is a drawing of someone with their eyes closed, showing how people choose to not acknowledge their cruelty and refuse to face it. It contrasts the drawing shown just before it which is of an unknown animal’s open eye (it’s supposed to be a pig’s eye but it could be interpreted as a human’s as well, or possibly others, which just goes to show our similarities). The line “Animals are viewed as inanimate objects … [like a] hamburger” is emphasised by a drawing of a hamburger on one side and a small cow on the other side with it saying “Cute!” to show the disconnect between people’s reaction to a hamburger versus the animal that is used to create it.
        </p>
        <p>Generally, people are against animal abuse. It is similar to the saying “One death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic”, in the way that people approach abuse. One death is especially going to be a tragedy if people have an emotional connection to the animal. But not only do people not have any attachment to the billions of animals killed yearly (trillions if you count fish), they actively participate in the killing of those animals!
