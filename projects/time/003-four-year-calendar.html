          <p><strong><u>Four-Year Calendar (B02):</u></strong><br>
            Also called the Seasonal Calendar, or the Leap-Year Calendar
          </p>

          <p><u>Length:</u> 1461 days</p>

          <p><u>Leap years:</u> every 25 cycles, except on multiples of 100<br>
            <u>Note:</u> on “leap years”, the year is not extended by 1 day, but actually is
            1 day shorter
          </p>

          <p><u>487 weeks of 3 days each:</u> Monday, Tuesday, Wendsday</p>

          <p>The work week is of 2 days working--on Monday and Tuesday--and 1 day resting--Wendsday. A ratio of 4:2 compared 
            to the standard 5:2.
          </p>

          <p><u>16 months, of name and length listed here in chronological order:</u></p>

          <p><ol>
            <li>Privera:     <strong>91</strong> days</li>

            <li>Tandestate:  <strong>91</strong> days</li>
            <li>Tandemunno:  <strong>92</strong> days</li>
            <li>Tandinverno: <strong>92</strong> days</li>
              
            <li>Total:       <strong>1461</strong> days</li>
          </ol></p>

          <p>Notice that each month corresponds to a season, a length of 3 months in the standard Gregorian calendar.</p>

          <p>The month names are a combination of Italian seasons and the Latin words for First, Second, Third, and Last.</p>

          <p>The year starts at the beginning of a Spring season (March 1st).</p>

          <p>This system lines up the months with the seasons, which the Consistent Calendar (B01) does not, and also, 
            because of its length of 4 Gregorian years (or 4 revolutions around the sun), incorporates the leap days of 
            a Gregorian calendar within one year in the B02 system, and only requires a leap year every 25 cycles, or 100 
            Gregorian years. Privera 1 is the same as March 1.
          </p>

          <p>In a leap year, the 15th month, Tandemunno, is only <strong>91</strong> days instead of <strong>92</strong>. 
            As a result, the last day 
            of the year, that would normally be a Wendsday, is instead a Tuesday, and there is no Wendsday for that week--it 
            goes back to Monday for the start of the next year without having a Wendsday, and only having a two day week. This 
            scenario creates a 4 day work week with only 1 rest day--Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday, Wendsday.</p>

          <p>The first day of every month is <strong>Game Day</strong>, described in B01.</p>

          <p><strong><u>Four-Year Calendar Revised (B02A):</u></strong><br>
            The Seasonal Revised Calendar
            </p>

          <p><u>Length:</u> 1460 (1461) days</p>

          <p><u>Leap years:</u> every 25 cycles, except on multiples of 100<br>
            <u>Note:</u> on “leap years”, the year is not extended by 1 day, but actually is 1 day shorter</p>
            
          <p><u>146 weeks of 10 days each:</u> Monday, Baldurday, Tuesday, Wendsday, Duensday, 
            Thursday, Friday, Ragisday, Saturday, Sunday</p>
            
          <p><u>Because the week is 10 days, 3 additional days of the week are added:</u></p>
          <p><ol>
            <li>Baldurday, after Monday, ——   named after Baldur</li>
            <li>Duensday,  after Wendsday, —— named after Idun</li>
            <li>Ragisday,  after Friday, ——   named after Bragi</li>
          </ol></p>
            
          <p>The work week is of 7 days working--Monday through Friday--and 3 days resting--Ragisday through Sunday. 
          A ratio of 14:6 compared to the standard 15:6.</p>
            
          <p>Alternatively, the work week can be of 6 days working--Monday through Thursday--and 4 days resting--Friday 
          through Sunday. A ratio of 3:2 compared to the standard 5:2.</p>
            
          <p><u>16 months:</u> The month names and lengths are the same as B02, except that the 15th month, Tandemunno, 
          is <strong>91</strong> days, for a total of <strong>1460</strong> days.</p>
            
          <p>Every cycle, except on leap years (described above), there is a day added to the beginning of the year 
          called New Day. It works exactly as in B01, wherein the day is not part of any month or day of the week.</p>
            
          <p>The first day of every month is <strong>Game Day</strong>, described in B01.</p>

          <p><strong><u>Dates of Holidays/events, and ages (B02AA):</u></strong><br></p>

          <p><u>Holidays/Events:</u></p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Holiday Season</strong> is celebrated from Prinverno 22-32, <strong>Christmas</strong> on Prinverno 26.<br>
            <strong>Halloween</strong> is celebrated on Duatunno 61.<br>
            <strong>Thanksgiving Day</strong> is celebrated on Tritunno 87.
          </p>

          <p>The <strong>Festival of Life</strong> is celebrated from Tandinverno 1-61, and is a celebration of life and the good of 
          it, and also the overcoming of hardships, struggles, etc. The celebration is meant to embolden people and bring 
          communities together over their experiences individually and collectively.</p>
            
          <p><strong>Leap Year Celebration</strong> is celebrated from Tandinverno 62-92 whenever the next cycle will be a leap 
          year (i.e. will not have a New Day at the beginning of the cycle, which only happens every 25 cycles).</p>
            
          <p>All other holidays happen once every four months, and correspond exactly with the Gregorian calendar.</p>
            
          <p><u>Ages:</u></p>
            
          <p>Someone’s age can be said either as only the number of cycles (Seasonal years) that they’ve been alive, or 
          they can also add the number of quarters through the cycle they are.</p>
            
          <p>For example, in the Four-Year Calendar (B02A), someone might say that they are 5 Seasonal years old. This 
          means that they are between 20 and 23 Gregorian years old.</p>
            
          <p>To narrow down the exact year in the Gregorian system, someone might add how many quarters of the Seasonal 
          year has passed since their birthday. The number of passed quarters is written after the Seasonal years and after a colon.</p>
            
          <p>Someone who is 14:3 (pronounced “fourteen and three” or simply “fourteen three”) Seasonal years old is 
          56 + 3 = 59 Gregorian years old.</p>
