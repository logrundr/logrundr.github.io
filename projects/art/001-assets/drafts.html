          <div align="justify">
            <p><em>1. Give a brief synopsis of your project’s argument, a few sentences to a paragraph should do.</em>
            </p>
            <p>I want my project to send a message about animal rights through several media simultaneously. My idea is to write a narrative poem (or at least some form of somewhat long poetry) that is accompanied by piano, as well as illustrations depicting imagery from the poem, similar to a comic. My main argument will be simple: animal cruelty is bad. I think most people would agree with that sentiment, but I want my poem to expose people’s hypocrisy, since most people that agree with that also directly support animal cruelty themselves (through eating meat, dairy, etc.)
            </p>
            <p><em>2. How does your project advance the audience’s knowledge of an issue?</em>
            </p>
            <p>I’m hoping that it will cause some introspection and make people realise that we treat different species of animals differently for no good reason.
            </p>
            <p><em>Why did you select your particular media?
            </em></p>
            <p>I was originally going to compose a piece for only solo piano, but I’m not confident enough in my playing nor my composing abilities. I then got the idea that I could add words to give more meaning and take some of the focus away from the piano. I’m not 100% sure that I’ll be adding the illustrations. It’s an interesting idea that I could take in a lot of different directions, and I like doodling. I could possibly even do a stop-motion animation using hand-drawn illustrations if I have the time.</p>
            <p><em>3. Detail the practical steps you need to take to complete the project, i.e. detail your creative process. What materials or equipment is necessary? Provide a rough schedule for your project.  
            </em></p>
            <p>(1) Write the long-form poem and map out where any significant changes in the music occur; (2) Record the piano part following cues in the poem; (3) Narrate the poem following the piano accompaniment to make sure rhythm is correct; (4) Possibly repeat steps 2 or 3 until components are good; (5) Create illustrations; (6) Piece together a video presentation that shows all components together simultaneously.
