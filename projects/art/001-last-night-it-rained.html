          <p><strong>[Opening] 1</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Last night it rained<br>
            And all throughout the night<br>
            under light from the stars<br>
            the worms emerged out of the dirt<br>
            to avoid being drowned 
            </p>
          <p>Last night it rained<br>
            And in the morning when the sun was rising<br>
            and the puddles were dissipating<br>
            I heard the sounds of the birds chirping<br>
            from outside my window 
            </p>
          <p>So today<br>
            The birds fly throughout the trees<br>
            But not without someone watching<br>
            And a <em>crack</em> emanates from the forest<br>
            As the chirping stops 
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Interlude 1] 2</strong>
          </p>
          <p>The sound of Hell<br>
            The torture of beings<br>
            Enslaved under their masters<br>
            Who will eventually kill them 
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Motif 1]</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Another being<br>
            A different being<br>
            Fetches a bone for its master<br>
            And is given a treat
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Motif 1’]<br>
            [Interlude 2] 3</strong>
            </p>
          <p><strong>Why</strong><br>
            Is one tortured, and another nurtured?
            </p>
          <p>Fundamentally different beings<br>
            But also similar, and the same
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Motif 2]</strong>
          </p>
          <p>People often don’t realise the harm<br>
            that their choices can have<br>
            Especially if they aren’t there<br>
            to see the victims
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Interlude 1’] 4</strong>
          </p>
          <p>It’s simple <br>
            to care for all beings<br>
            A language barrier is not enough of a barrier<br>
            To obscure seeing the value of things
            </p>
          <p>A pig<br>
            Is no smarter than a three year old child<br>
            But can that be a justification<br>
            for our treatment of them?
            </p>
          <p>A human<br>
            With the mental capacity of a child<br>
            Would surely be treated better<br>
            Than pigs are
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Motif 2]</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Indeed, there is no real excuse<br>
            The only excuse is our tradition
            </p>
          <p>Our tradition of cruelty
          </p>
          <p><strong>[Interlude 3] 5</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Animals are viewed as inanimate objects<br>
            Because they are used to create them<br>
            <strong>Things</strong> like a fur coat,<br>
            Or leather shoes,<br>
            Or a hamburger
            </p>
          <p>Even if people claim to be against animal abuse<br>
            They still participate in it<br>
            Because they aren’t aware, <br>
            of what’s really happening
            </p>
          <p>Animals are so victimised<br>
            That they have ceased<br>
            To even be thought of as victims
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Motif 3]</strong>
          </p>
          <p>All of our morals<br>
            That we were ever taught<br>
            Disregarded completely if someone <br>
            Seems too different from you <br>
            for them to matter
            </p>
          <p>Our cruel treatment of animals<br>
            And our view of them as inferior<br>
            Is used as justification<br>
            For so many acts against humans
            </p>
          <p><strong>[Interlude 4] heroic 6</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Don’t kill or mistreat animals<br>
            It’s that simple<br>
            And it’s really very easy
            </p>

          <p>My project was about bringing awareness to animal rights. It was presented in a video that consisted of music, narrated poem, and illustrations. I’m not very good at conveying emotion with my voice, which is why I chose to include music because that helps carry the mood. In the end, I feel that my voice ended up working well with the organ. The reason that I chose the organ instead of something else like a piano, or possibly guitar, is because on an organ I can change the registration, which basically means that I can get many different sounds out of it which would further convey emotion.
          </p>
          <p>The beginning three stanzas constitute an autobiographical poem that describes my loneliness and feelings of isolation around people who don’t respect my lifestyle and way of living. To see people who are otherwise good eating animals and making cruel food choices (and often cruel ethical choices in general) all around me can be incredibly disturbing. 
          </p>
          <p>The very opening line of the piece, “Last night it rained”, is really supposed to be alluding to it raining blood, and I mention that the worms came out of the dirt to avoid being drowned by the rain (blood)—symbolising animals attempting to avoid their impending death. However, in the next stanza it’s implied that the chirping birds ate the worms, and that I am an onlooker to this (“I heard … from outside my window”). This is representative of the struggle of having to deal with watching people eat dead animals all the time. 
          </p>
          <p>Section two begins after a short interlude with a descending line on the organ, which anticipates the next line of the poem, “The sound of Hell”, because the organ notes descend downwards “into Hell”. Section two compares the treatment of two animal species, which are referred to as “beings” in the poem because I didn’t want to make it seem that they were different by calling them by their different names. By unifying them under one name of “being”, it shows that they are both similar. The cruel treatment of the first creature is emphasised by alternating dissonant chords on the organ, and when the second is given a treat, the organ changes from a minor key (B flat minor) to a major key (B flat minor’s relative major, which is D flat major) that goes up into an ascending line—a parallel of the descending line which started the section.
          </p>
          <p>Sections three and four make the argument that all animals are equal, and that our only reason for eating certain animals and keeping others as pets is tradition. With the lines, “People don’t often realise the harm / that their choices can have / especially if they aren’t there / to see the victims”, there is a drawing of someone with their eyes closed, showing how people choose to not acknowledge their cruelty and refuse to face it. It contrasts the drawing shown just before it which is of an unknown animal’s open eye (it’s supposed to be a pig’s eye but it could be interpreted as a human’s as well, or possibly others, which just goes to show our similarities). The line “Animals are viewed as inanimate objects … [like a] hamburger” is emphasised by a drawing of a hamburger on one side and a small cow on the other side with it saying “Cute!” to show the disconnect between people’s reaction to a hamburger versus the animal that is used to create it.
          </p>
          <p>Generally, people are against animal abuse. It is similar to the saying “One death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic”, in the way that people approach abuse. One death is especially going to be a tragedy if people have an emotional connection to the animal. But not only do people not have any attachment to the billions of animals killed yearly (trillions if you count fish), they actively participate in the killing of those animals!
