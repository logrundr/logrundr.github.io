            <p>
              a person who has beauty on the inside (in their mind). This means someone who is insightful, philosophical, optimistic, creative, and
              ever-changing, in all the right ways—as well as being charming and all of those other charismatic traits. Someone who is never angry,
              and always has something beautiful to say about any situation. 
              It is an ideal which can never truly be reached fully, only partially.<br>

            <p>
              forced love: "settling" for someone lesser than what you know you really want; when you force yourself to try to love 
              someone and you force yourself into a relationship despite a lack of real connection.
            </p>
            <p>
              natural love: "soul-mates", in a way; the kind of love where you know right away that you love them, because everything 
              about them is immediately perfect (in your perception).

            <p>
              a type of mindset which helps one to appreciate art more: whenever one is engaging with a work of art, either visual, 
              spatial, aural, or some other medium, look past the art and imagine its creator—but further than just imagining the 
              creator, imagine the creator's mind, and specifically ask yourself, "what kind of mind must theirs be in order to 
              create such beautiful art?"

            <p>
              an impossible world where everything is always perfect, forever, which goes against the most fundamental property of the Universe:
              that which says that everything is impermanent. Such a perfect world wouldn't have work, money, government (since there is no need 
              to govern perfect individuals), death, pain, boredom, etc. It would be a world of <a href="#beautifulperson">Beautiful people</a>.

            <p>
              all forms of discrimination are interconnected in a big web, informing and encouraging each other, and supporting 
              each other to continue existing and oppressing. This web consists not only of human discrimination, but of 
              non-human forms too; and the human and non-human discriminations both encourage and support each other in 
              the same ways that different types of human discriminations do.

              If we always have this hierarchy where 
              animals are at the very bottom, then it’s easy for us to make ourselves unequal by comparing certain groups of 
              people to animals, to the bottom of the hierarchy.
